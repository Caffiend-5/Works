      "          <p>From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4â959â790 participants (3â045â905 males, 1â913â885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100â000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100â000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100â000 in 2008 to 162 per 100â000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100â000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100â000 in 2008 to 7 per 100â000 in 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria. Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases.</p>\n",

Yet there has been no systematic study of the changing patterns of infectious diseases in China. With the objective of highlighting public health policy priorities, we analysed recent trends across time and by age, sex, season, and province for 44 notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents using web based surveillance CISDCP data from 2008 to 2017.</p>\n",

      "        <p>Data were drawn from CISDCP. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, China updated and established the web based CISDCP to rapidly identify new cases and respond to outbreaks. Since 2008 all case based data on notifiable infectious diseases are transmitted electronically to the China Centre for Disease Control (CDC) through direct online reporting. The system covers national notifiable infectious diseases for all 31 provinces in mainland China. We analysed data for the decade from 2008 to 2017. All types of health facilities in China are covered in the CISDCP, including hospitals, Centers for Disease Control (CDCs) at each level, community health centres, township health centres, and village clinics. Supplementary figures S1 and S2 present the national coverage rates of CISDCP network reporting and its geographical variations by year from 2008 to 2017 for township level and for county level and above. The national average coverage rates of CISDCP remained stable during this decade, ranging from 85.1% to 95.4%. In 2017, web based reporting covered 87.2% national health facilities. The national coverage rates for health facilities at county level and above were higher than that at the township level (ie, in 2017, county level and above was 95.8% and township level was 85.5%). Coverage was also higher in the eastern regions than in the western regions in each year (ie, in 2017, coverage in the eastern region was 95.1%, central region was 94.5%, and western region was 81.6%).</p>\n",

Hepatitis C was classified within an extended category of sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections and hepatitis E similarly for zoonotic infections. The revised categories were quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne (see <xref rid=\"tbl1\" ref-type=\"table\">table 1</xref>).

Incidence and mortality were the core indicators. Pie graphs were used to analyse the trends and the characteristics of distribution of each infectious disease for incidence, number of cases, and deaths. Stacked plots were used to analyse the trends in proportions of all the infectious diseases by categories. We compared the ranks and proportions of each notifiable infectious disease for incidence, number of cases, and deaths in each year and changes over the study period. Age and province specific disease in each survey year and the seasonal variation of each disease by month were also analysed. To identify the features of major infectious diseases we extracted the top infectious disease for each age and province. We compared the characteristics of trends from 2008 to 2017 in the leading infectious diseases by age from 6 to 22 years.

Joinpoint regression analysis identifies time points in which trends significantly change (ie, joinpoints), using calendar year as the timescale.<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref> To determine the location of the joinpoints, we used the grid search method.

      "<xref rid=\"ref25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref> Joinpoint regression assumes normal distribution of disease incidence. If this assumption does not hold, data transformation is recommended. In our data, some infectious diseases had Poisson distributions and required a logarithmic transformation to approximate a normal distribution. The resulting log-linear models were easier to interpret in the joinpoint regression analysis. Under a log-linear model, rates change at a constant percentage each year, calculated in our study as a fixed APC, whereas in a linear model, the rates change at a constant amount each year. When comparing trends in different categories or for specific infectious diseases or across provinces, the rates are different. The advantage of a log-linear model is that the APC can be compared across widely different scales. For example, rare and common infectious diseases might change at the same annual percentage each year, but it is unlikely that they would change at the same fixed amount each year. With this approach, infectious diseases were assumed to change at a constant percentage of the rate of the previous year. For example, if the APC was 1% and the rate was 50 per 100â000 in 2007, then in 2008 the rate was 50Ã1.01=50.5, and in 2009 the rate was 50.5Ã1.01=51.005. Rates that change at a constant percentage every year change linearly on a log scale. The P value for a two sided test that the true APC is zero was calculated based on a t distribution. If the APC was non-significant (Pâ¥0.05), we regarded trends as stable, otherwise, it increased or decreased for each infectious disease from 2008 to 2017.</p>\n",

Japanese encephalitis remained the leading vectorborne disease in most provinces, followed by typhus and dengue. For the zoonotic infections, western China was also a high incidence area. Hepatitis E and brucellosis were dominant in most provinces, whereas hydatid disease was only endemic in Tibet. For bacterial infections, although scarlet fever was highly prevalent in some provinces in the eastern regions, such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, tuberculosis remained the leading bacterial disease in most provinces, particularly Tibet and Qinghai. Among sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections, hepatitis C predominated in most provinces, with the highest incidence in Qinghai and Xinjiang. HIV/AIDS was the most common sexually transmitted disease and bloodborne infection in some eastern provinces, such as Chongqing and Beijing. Syphilis dominated in Tibet and Fujian, whereas gonorrhoea was highest in Zhejiang and Hainan. Overall, Chinaâs western regions had a disproportionate and continuing burden from many categories of infectious diseases. For example, compared with eastern regions, several western provinces, such as Qinghai, Tibet, and Xinjiang, had a higher incidence of vaccine preventable diseases, sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections, bacterial infections, and zoonotic infections.</p>\n",

      "      <p>From 2008 to 2017 China has had remarkable progress in infectious disease control in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased sharply, and HIV/AIDS has replaced rabies and tuberculosis as the leading cause of death, particularly among adolescent boys older than about 14 years. The incidence of most vaccine preventable diseases is now at low levels, but seasonal variation in mumps, rubella, measles, and influenza suggests these diseases should remain a priority for public policy. Quarantinable diseases with high mortality have effectively disappeared, and vectorborne diseases have declined. The increase in incidence of HIV/AIDS together with gonorrhoea and syphilis suggests that sexually transmitted diseases have become a priority. Although typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline, the incidence of other gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant. Tuberculosis continued to be the most common bacterial infection, and cases of scarlet fever doubled during the past decade. Noticeable regional variation in trends in infectious diseases was observed, with western China generally carrying a disproportionate burden.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Of the vaccine preventable diseases, hepatitis B, mumps, and seasonal influenza remained prominent.<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref> Although the incidence of hepatitis B declined from 2008 to 2017, it remained the leading reportable infection in children and adolescents in most provinces. Chinaâs childhood hepatitis vaccination programme and improved sanitation have contributed to the decrease in incidence of hepatitis A and B, contrasting with an increasing incidence in Chinese adults.<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref> Both hepatitis A and B vaccines were included in the national immunisation programme (in 2008 and 2001, respectively) and a vaccine against hepatitis E virus is now licensed in China.<xref rid=\"ref29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref> The implementation of mumps into the expanded programme for immunisation in mainland China in 2008 would have contributed to its decreasing incidence,<xref rid=\"ref30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref> but in the past two years its incidence has increased so that it is now the most common infection in children and adolescents aged 10-22 years. The reasons for this rebound remain unclear but raise questions around vaccine coverage, notwithstanding that other vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, rubella, pertussis, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, and neonatal tetanus have shown continuing declines. The number of rabies cases has also declined, reflecting comprehensive preventive measures, including vaccination of dogs and post-exposure prophylaxis.<xref rid=\"ref31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "      <p>Tuberculosis and scarlet fever were the most common bacterial infections. Tuberculosis is the 11th leading cause of death worldwide and was the leading cause of death from infectious disease in Chinese children and adolescents in 2017.<xref rid=\"ref32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref> Globally, the incidence of tuberculosis has declined, with a 19% fall between 2000 and 2016.<xref rid=\"ref33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref> While the incidence of tuberculosis among Chinese children and adolescents aged 6-22 years decreased, with an annual average decline of 5.1% from 2008 to 2017, its overall ranking remained unchanged. Incidence was higher in children and adolescents aged between 12 and 22 years compared with younger children aged between 6 and 11 years, consistent with previously documented age trends.<xref rid=\"ref34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref> Chinaâs scaling-up of its national tuberculosis control programme to cover half the population during the 1990s and the entire population from 2000 seems likely to have contributed to this decline.<xref rid=\"ref35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref> Multidrug resistant tuberculosis is emerging as a challenge in tuberculosis control in China.<xref rid=\"ref36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref> In 2017, around 3.5% of new cases of tuberculosis in both children and adults were multidrug resistant, with an 18% prevalence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis among those previously treated.<xref rid=\"ref36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>\n",

Similar measures have also been recommended for childhood gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases (infectious diarrhoea; dysentery; hand, foot, and mouth disease; typhoid and paratyphoid; and acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis),<xref rid=\"ref40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref> but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. Scarlet fever had the highest incidence of any infectious disease in the eastern and northern regions and in 6 to 11 year olds, but tuberculosis dominated the rest of China and in those aged 12 to 22 years. Such variation suggests a need for age and region specific control measures.</p>\n",
      "      <p>The incidence and number of cases of HIV/AIDS in Chinese adolescent males aged from 14 to 22 years have rapidly increased from 2008 to 2017, with HIV/AIDS now the leading notifiable infectious cause of death in Chinese children and adolescents, particularly males. The increasing incidence of HIV seems to be related to high risk sexual behaviours and poor awareness of HIV/AIDS prevention.<xref rid=\"ref41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref> By the end of 2018, 149â000 people with newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS had been reported, 95% of which were sexually transmitted. Of these, 16â000 new HIV/AIDS cases were reported among 15-24 year olds. College and university students accounted for more than 3000 cases, with more than 80% in men who had sex with men.<xref rid=\"ref42\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref> Chinaâs latest national survey shows that by 2019 the transmission of HIV through blood transfusion effectively no longer occurred, and transmission through intravenous drug misuse and mother-to-child transmission had been curbed. Globally, one sixth of AIDS related deaths and one seventh of new HIV infections are in children younger than 15 years, with 90% caused by mother-to-child transmission.<xref rid=\"ref43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref> A meta-analysis of 57 studies that covered all provinces in China showed that the rate of mother-to-child transmission in China was 4.4% (95% confidence interval 3.2% to 5.5%), substantially higher than in the US and Europe (&lt;1%), but lower than in some low and middle income countries in sub-Saharan Africa (11%).<xref rid=\"ref44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "      <p>Sexual transmission, notably in men who have sex with men, has become the main transmission route, especially among college students.<xref rid=\"ref42\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref> There have been a range of other contributing factors, including a lack of access to appropriate sex education in secondary schools, a heteronormative approach to the content of sex education, a permissive attitude towards casual sex in university students, and ready access to sex, facilitated by social media.<xref rid=\"ref41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref> In 2015, the Chinese government introduced initiatives targeting HIV in adolescents and young adults age from 15 to 49 years,<xref rid=\"ref46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref> with the health and education ministries jointly establishing an epidemic notification system tied with stronger school based HIV prevention and control measures<xref rid=\"ref47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref>; strategies that coincide with a decrease in incidence. However, the global campaign for comprehensive sex education launched by UNESCO in 2018 should be promoted further in China to provide children and adolescents with an evidence based understanding of their sexual and reproductive health, and with the skills to talk with their peers, families, and communities about safe and consensual sexual relationships.<xref rid=\"ref48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref> There is also a pressing need for other school and university based interventions, including network peer education, psychological counselling and education, and access to rapid testing for sexually transmitted infections.<xref rid=\"ref49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref> In addition to the lower incidence of sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections in young children, the major causes of such diseases are likely to differ.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Achievements and challenges</title>\n",
      "        <p>Overall, China has made great advances in the prevention and control of infectious diseases in children and adolescents. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a substantial investment was made in capacity building for laboratory testing, surveillance system enhancement, national intervention programmes for specific diseases, and collaboration with international partners.<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> The major Special National Science And Technology Project On Preventing And Controlling Infectious Diseases that began in 2008 has received a total investment of about $2.25bn (Â£1.77bn; â¬2.00bn).<xref rid=\"ref50\" ref-type=\"bibr\">50</xref> This project has led to expanded and enhanced screening for infectious diseases, reductions in treatment costs, and increased access to treatment. Furthermore, the national immunisation programme for children in China was expanded in 2008, which is thought to have contributed to the marked reduction in the overall number of cases of vaccine preventable diseases found in the current study.<xref rid=\"ref51\" ref-type=\"bibr\">51</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref52\" ref-type=\"bibr\">52</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>Beyond immunisation programmes, multisectoral collaboration also underpins efforts to control infectious diseases. In China, some parasitic diseases (eg, schistosomiasis) have reached or are approaching elimination status; the result of collaboration between the departments of health, agriculture, and the environment.<xref rid=\"ref53\" ref-type=\"bibr\">53</xref> Our findings are consistent with filariasis being eliminated during the study period, as certified by the World Health Organization in 2007.<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> Schistosomiasis in adolescents in China is also close to elimination, and malaria has steadily declined from 3221 cases in 2008 to only 25 cases in 2017, consistent with the goal of nationwide elimination by 2020.<xref rid=\"ref54\" ref-type=\"bibr\">54</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>China still, however, faces challenges in responding to infectious diseases in children and adolescents. Firstly, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation and changing patterns of interactions between people and pathogens have altered the pattern of infectious diseases,<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> a feature of the covid-2019 outbreak. Geographical disparities raise questions around access to healthcare, other medical and educational resources, public health programmes, and infrastructure in rural and remote areas. Not surprisingly, the western regions of China with poor resources and a special geographical environment and culture face a burden from multiple infectious diseases, with Qinghai, Tibet, and Xinjiang having higher incidence of vaccine preventable diseases, bacterial infections, and sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections. However, the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diseases are also affected by densely populated urban regions,<xref rid=\"ref55\" ref-type=\"bibr\">55</xref> which might contribute to higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases and viral gastrointestinal infections, at least in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Different factors apply in rural and remote areas, where livestock based lifestyles increase the risk of zoonotic infections and where climate might be an additional factor, particularly for vectorborne diseases. Seasonal variation in infectious diseases, with the example of peaks of influenza and rubella, measles, and scarlet fever in winter and spring suggests the high vulnerability of Chinese children to infections transmitted by aerosol droplets. Furthermore, the rapid increase in HIV/AIDS, especially in adolescent males, requires a much wider set of social and educational responses than for less sensitive behaviours and stigmatised diseases. The resurgence of some diseases that were previously under control (eg, scarlet fever, mumps, syphilis, and brucellosis) and imported cases (eg, Zika virus infection, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and Ebola) have put greater pressure on the public health system, as has been seen with the current covid-2019 outbreak that began in Hubei province, China. Although in most cases of covid-19, mortality appears to be higher in older people,<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref> although the immediate impact of this on children and adolescents is nonetheless immense. A global pandemic of covid-19 could bring about multiple impacts, such as economic recession, food crisis, price fluctuations, constraints on resources, which will have immediate or indirect negative effects on children in the near or long term. In addition, the exact impact has not yet been determined in further studies, but there could be physical and psychological effects on children who have been deprived of concentrated effort of care as a result of the guardianâs illness, which need further studies post-covid-19.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title>\n",
      "        <p>In this study of infectious diseases in Chinese children and adolescents, we used systematic, long term, and comprehensive assessment coupled with high diagnostic accuracy. Under regulations from the China Centers for Disease Controlâs (CDC) China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP), health facilities are required to report all cases of notifiable infectious diseases through the web based system, with the validity of the surveillance system being continuously monitored. In terms of system coverage, although CISDCP has not yet reached all health facilities in China, all types of health facilities are covered, including hospitals, CDCs, community health centres, township health centres, and village clinics. Total coverage is at least 85% throughout the country with more than 95% coverage of county level and above facilities each year (see supplementary fig S1). Among 69â881 facilities with reported case information in 2014, the participation levels were 3597 CDCs (100%), 13â764 hospitals (97%), and 37â494 township level clinics (89%).<xref rid=\"ref56\" ref-type=\"bibr\">56</xref> Despite this, the national coverage of CISDCP remains biased to some extent. The coverage within some provinces, particularly in the less developed provinces in western China, such as Tibet (18.6%), Qinghai (66.8%), and inner Mongolia (58.5%), was lower than in eastern more developed regions (95.1%). Furthermore, coverage of township level health facilities in rural areas remained less than that in urban cities with facilities above county level. It is therefore likely that we have underestimated infectious diseases in western less developed regions, and in remote towns and rural areas of China (see supplementary fig S2).</p>\n",
      "        <p>A second consideration is the validity of the surveillance system and accuracy of diagnosis. Generally, although suspected cases, pathogen carriers, and confirmed cases are all entered into CISDCP, in the present study we only analysed patients with a diagnosis confirmed by both uniform clinical standards and laboratory tests (ie, examination of, for example, pathogen, serology, imaging; see supplementary table S5 and the appendix). Decisions about diagnosis are overseen by professional trained specialists from the CISDCP, which ensures a high level of accuracy within this sample. For example, the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS is based on laboratory serum testing for HIV antibody and the detection of pathogens, combined with clinical symptoms and epidemiological data. However, under-reporting will be variable, most likely for people with subclinical and asymptomatic infections being managed at home, especially for seasonal influenza; hand, foot, and mouth disease; and infectious diarrhoea, particularly in remote areas. In contrast, serious infections that are highly contagious and might result in outbreaks or epidemics (categories A and B in Chinaâs domestic notifiable infectious diseases classification; see supplementary table S4) will have high sensitivity and specificity. This includes the plague, cholera, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis A, tuberculosis, dysentery, and measles. It is possible that variable clinical expertise and technical expertise influences the number of confirmed cases in any setting. However, all 44 notifiable diseases in CISDCP have well established case definitions and diagnostic pathways, incorporating clinical features identification, laboratory confirmation, reporting procedures, and determination of specific pathogens. Nearly all of the 44 notifiable diseases had consistent case definitions and diagnostic criteria across the decade. Considering the consistent geographical variations in CISDCP coverage and the definitions and diagnostic criteria, and the stability of pathogenicity of most pathogenic agents, the likelihood of variation over time for subclinical and asymptomatic cases in the 44 notifiable diseases over the past decade is unlikely to have affected the trend analyses reported here. We note that estimates of the burden of death might vary between countries for mortality from seasonal influenza. For example, in China the use of estimates from death certificates that specifically list influenza will underestimate the burden of influenza, whereas the mathematical model to estimate the number of influenza deaths such as used in the United States could result in overestimation.<xref rid=\"ref57\" ref-type=\"bibr\">57</xref> Clearly, new challenges for the surveillance system are posed by emerging infectious diseases with an unclear disease course, such as covid-2019.</p>\n",
      "        <p>One further limitation of our study is that the study population were Chinese students. As we excluded children and adolescents who were not studying, we are unable to comment on the epidemiology of infectious diseases in preschool children.<xref rid=\"ref58\" ref-type=\"bibr\">58</xref> Given the free nine year compulsory education system in China, it is likely that the data for the younger student population will be broadly representative of this age group. The estimate bias in our study is likely to be higher with age (see supplementary fig S11), which might lead to underestimation of the actual burden of infectious diseases in adolescents, particularly for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections. Because of the social stigma around some sexually transmitted diseases, and lack of health service use for milder gastrointestinal infections, we could have underestimated the burden from these diseases.<xref rid=\"ref59\" ref-type=\"bibr\">59</xref> Although more males than females in each age group were not included in the analysis, the percentage of girls not included was larger (17.0% <italic>v</italic> 19.8%). As a result, although we underestimated the number of boys with notifiable infectious diseases nationally, the rates of underestimation were probably higher among girls who completed school early after nine year compulsory education (see supplementary fig S12). Both the number and the rates of underestimation of infectious disease burdens among children and adolescents of all occupations in this age group could be high in several provinces with large populations and high floating or mobile populations and low educational participation, such as Guangdong (non-students rates of 22.6%), Henan (24.9%), and Sichuan (20.0%; see supplementary fig S13).</p>\n",

      "        <title>Conclusion and policy implications</title>\n",
      "        <p>From 2008 to 2017, China achieved impressive reductions in the burden from infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6 to 22 years. This complements the reduction in mortality from infectious diseases in under 5sâa longstanding focus of the Millennium Development Goals, and will contribute to reductions in the overall burden from infectious diseases in China.<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref60\" ref-type=\"bibr\">60</xref> However, Chinaâs rapid success poses challenges for policy makers as priorities for infectious disease control continue to evolve. Beyond maintaining the gains, the priorities for the coming decade include reducing regional inequalities; scaling-up vaccination for mumps, seasonal influenza, and hepatitis B; preventing further escalation of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases; and redoubling efforts around persisting diseases, including tuberculosis, rabies, and scarlet fever. Different responses will be needed by region and by age across childhood and adolescence, while the newer emerging disease epidemics will require rapid and targeted responses. Seasonal variation in respiratory infections and in gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases reflect the high vulnerability of children and adolescents. A comprehensive national surveillance system remains an integral part of infectious disease control in these age groups to maintain the gains of recent decades and respond effectively to new epidemics.</p>\n",

As in the case study, urinalysis can rapidly screen for renal involvement in a multi-system disease. Patients with haematuria or proteinuria in this context have a high probability of having AAV. This probability is ~2% if the dipstick findings occur in isolation, rising to 85% if there is concomitant sinus and pulmonary disease.<xref rid=\"ref17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>\n",

      "          <p>I initially visited my GP in August 2018 after feeling very tired and experiencing headaches and nausea. I had been having some night sweats but had self-diagnosed this as a peri-menopausal symptom. I was also caring for my mum who had terminal cancer, and my two kids alongside running a charity so put most of my symptoms down to stress and anxiety. I explained this to my GP who said he would like to check some blood tests, which surprised me. I thought he was just being thorough and fully expected the results to be fine. The next day he called to explain that I needed to be admitted to hospital as my kidneys were not working properly. My initial reaction was shock as I still felt relatively well; however, in hindsight, there were a few minor âwarning signsâ over the past year that I had ignored. These were very minor though, and it is worrying that there were not more obvious signs that something was wrong. I had no idea you could feel so well until things were so critical with your kidneys. After a few tests including a kidney biopsy, I was diagnosed with vasculitis. I was started on various treatments, including plasma exchange. I am now on lots of medication and have 6 monthly rituximab infusions to suppress my disease. I am back at work and although I have to take life a little slower, I am generally very well and feeling good. I will be forever grateful to my intuitive GP who really listened to me and didnât delay in testing me. This most likely saved me from dialysis and I can never thank him or the renal team enough for their swift care. I really hope this is a reminder to other doctors that testing early, with such minor symptoms, can be lifesaving.</p>\n",

The disease has become a critical health concern worldwide owing to its high prevalence and related disability and mortality.<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref> The prevalence and number of adults with diabetes has increased at a greater rate in low and middle income countries than in high income countries. This rise in prevalence has been compounded by a growing and ageing population, nearly quadrupling the number of adults with diabetes from 1980 to 2014 worldwide.<xref rid=\"ref3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref> The increase in prevalence could also be partially attributable to the new diagnostic criteria, with reduced cut-off points for blood glucose and the addition of glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>). The American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria and World Health Organization (WHO) criteria are shown in <xref rid=\"tbl1\" ref-type=\"table\">table 1</xref>. The main difference between them is the inclusion of HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the ADA criteria.<xref rid=\"ref4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>\n",

Developed, developing, and underdeveloped cities were defined based on gross domestic product per capita, concentration of commercial resources, the extent to which a city serves as a commercial hub, vitality of residents, diversity of lifestyle, and future growth potential. Six tiers of cities were categorised from developed to underdeveloped cities, each two tiers being defined as a rank and thus three ranks in all. The cities with tier 1 and new tier 1 were classified as developed cities, tiers 2 and 3 as developing cities, and tiers 4 and tier 5 as underdeveloped cities (supplementary table 1).</p>\n",

At the third stage, two residential communities were randomly selected from each district. At the final stage, eligible people who met the inclusion criteria and were registered as local residents were randomly selected and stratified by age and sex. The composition of age and sex of each community and urban-rural ratio were decided based on Chinaâs 2010 national census data.<xref rid=\"ref17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref> Parallel random sampling was performed in rural locations (supplementary fig 1).</p>\n",

A total of 80â937 participants completed the survey and the overall response rate was 92.1%. Our analysis included 75â880 participants after excluding 5057 people with missing information on sex, age, plasma glucose, or HbA<sub>1c</sub> (supplementary fig 1).

Estimates were weighted to reflect age, sex, and urban-rural, distribution of provinces of the adults living in China. Weighting coefficients were derived from the 2010 Chinese population census data, and the sampling scheme of our survey was to obtain a national estimate. Briefly, the weighting coefficient was the inverse of the adjusted probability of obtaining the data for the respondent; each individual case in the analysis was assigned a certain coefficient (individual weight), by which it was multiplied to represent the actual population with the same characteristics of sex, age, province, and location. Standard errors were calculated with appropriate statistical techniques with data from the complex survey design. Categorical data are presented as percentages and 95% confidence intervals and were analysed by a Ï<sup>2</sup> test or Fisherâs exact test, as appropriate. Continuous data are described with means and 95% CIs. A binomial logit regression was used to examine the association of risk factors with the odds of total diabetes and prediabetes. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Secondly, a similar study design and statistical methods to those used previously make our findings more comparable with historical data. Although lacking a high quality national cohort to estimate the incidence of diabetes, our findings could add value to the assessment of diabetes epidemics in mainland China.

Secondly, using levels of 6.5% for HbA<sub>1c</sub> to diagnose diabetes could be controversial since that level was set for the US population. Although geographic disparities might exist in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, a consistent threshold was preferred across the study to enable comparison. Thirdly, owing to our study design, we could not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Fourthly, we did not carry out repeat testing in people with abnormal glucose values over time. We categorised one reading as being synonymous with diabetes, which may overestimate the prevalence, compared with clinical practice.<xref rid=\"ref29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref> Lastly, non-residents, such as internal migrant workers, who account for more than a sixth of the nationâs total population in China and who were more likely to have a lower prevalence of diabetes, were not included in the study owing to the study design.<xref rid=\"ref30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>\n",

      "          <p>Women with any of the five complications at term showed a substantially increased risk of preterm delivery in the next pregnancy. The absolute risks for preterm delivery in a second pregnancy were 3.1% with none of the five term complications (8202/265â043), 6.1% after term pre-eclampsia (688/11â225), 7.3% after term placental abruption (41/562), 13.1% after term stillbirth (72/551), 10.0% after term neonatal death (22/219), and 6.7% after term small for gestational age (463/6939). The unadjusted relative risk for preterm birth after term pre-eclampsia was 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.1), after term placental abruption was 2.3 (1.7 to 3.1), after term stillbirth was 4.2 (3.4 to 5.2), after term neonatal death was 3.2 (2.2 to 4.8), and after term small for gestational age was 2.2 (2.0 to 2.4). On average, the risk of preterm birth was increased 2.0-fold (1.9-fold to 2.1-fold) with one term complication in the first pregnancy, and 3.5-fold (2.9-fold to 4.2-fold) with two or more complications. The associations persisted after excluding recurrence of the specific complication in the second pregnancy. These links between term complications and preterm delivery were also seen in the reverse direction: preterm birth in the first pregnancy predicted complications in second pregnancies delivered at term.</p>\n",

      "          <p>Pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, stillbirth, neonatal death, or small for gestational age experienced in a first term pregnancy are associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent preterm delivery. Term complications seem to share important underlying causes with preterm delivery that persist from pregnancy to pregnancy, perhaps related to a motherâs predisposition to disorders of placental function.</p>\n",

Gestational age was defined as completed weeks and is based on the date of the last menstrual period. Exceptions were those with missing information on last menstrual period or for which the last menstrual period differed from the ultrasound result by more than 10 days, in which case we used the ultrasound result, or for pregnancies conceived by in vitro fertilisation for which we used the date of embryo transfer plus 14 days.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We identified five complications or poor outcomes of term pregnancy for analysis: pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, stillbirth, neonatal death, and small for gestational age. For the sake of simplicity, we refer to these collectively as âcomplications.â The causes of these complications are complex and include placental dysfunction.<xref rid=\"ref3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>\n",

      "        <p>Before 1999, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and placental abruption had been recorded in the medical birth registry as free text. From 1999, check boxes for these outcomes were added to the registry forms, which improved data quality. The pre-eclampsia outcome includes pregnancies with pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, or eclampsia, as well as chronic hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia. A validation study of pre-eclampsia diagnosis as recorded in the birth registry (1999-2010), found a satisfactory positive predictive value (84%) and high specificity (99%) but low sensitivity (43%)âthat is, the registry misclassifies a substantial number of cases (mostly mild) as non-cases.<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref> All cases of eclampsia since 1999 are verified by hospitals.</p>\n",

Separate models were used for each term complication. The reference for each model was first pregnancies at term with none of the five complications. Our focus is on prediction, in the same way that preterm delivery in the first pregnancy is an important predictor of later preterm birth. For this reason, we present unadjusted relative risks as the main finding, without adjustment for possible shared causal factors that might contribute to predictive power. In additional analysis, we adjusted for known demographic and lifestyle factors that might contribute to the observed associations.</p>\n",

We therefore ran an additional model estimating the associations between having any one complication, or any two or more complications, and the subsequent risk of preterm birth. Despite population level data being available for more than a decade, numbers were too small to consider unique combinations of complications. We therefore modelled the variables no complication, any one complication, and any two or more complications in a single model.</p>\n",
      "          <p>A complication of term pregnancy might contribute to a future preterm birth if the same complication recurred before term in the next pregnancy.

      "          <p>A previous complication at term might also increase preterm birth by prompting clinicians to deliver babies shortly before term to avoid recurrence of the same term outcome. To the extent this occurs, we would expect an excess of preterm births to occur in the later preterm weeks (weeks 34-36). We therefore assessed the risk of delivery across the full range of gestational weeks, using all pregnancies in utero at the beginning of each week interval as the denominator (a fetuses at risk approach). Specifically, the risk of birth in a given gestational week interval (20-24, 25-27, 28-30, 31-33, 34 â36, 37-38, 39-40, and 41-42 weeks) was expressed as births occurring in the given interval divided by all fetuses in utero at the beginning of that interval.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Clinical intervention resulting in preterm birth in the second pregnancy might also be suggested if estimates differed between spontaneous and induced preterm births. We examined the associations within mutually exclusive stratums of preterm birth that capture the initiation of labour: spontaneous or iatrogenic (including induced labour and caesarean section). Caesarean section in this context captures only deliveries where the procedure was performed before the spontaneous or medically induced onset of labour.</p>\n",

We adjusted for known risk factors at the time of the first pregnancy to avoid introducing bias from factors that might have changed as a result of a poor outcome in the first pregnancy. Information on smoking and BMI was available for the more recent subset of data (smoking in births occurring in 1999-2015 and BMI in births occurring in 2006-15). Smoking behaviour at the end of pregnancy was dichotomised into non-smoking (reference) and any smoking (occasional and daily smoking). Adjustment for smoking excluded 48â914 women (21%) with missing data.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Weight and height have been registered through an electronic birth notification system that the birth registry has gradually adopted since 2006, and which was not complete until 2014. The proportion of women with registered height and weight increased from 0.1% in 2006 to 72% in 2014.<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref> For our analysis, we divided prepregnancy BMI into three categories: 15-24.9 (reference), 25-29.9, and 30 or more.

A less likely possibility is that such associations could be caused by physiological damage to the maternal reproductive system from the earlier complication. If this were true, we would not expect associations to hold in the reverse directionâpreterm birth in the first pregnancy should not increase the risk of term complications in the next pregnancy. We therefore assessed preterm birth in the first pregnancy as a risk factor for term complications in the second pregnancy, excluding women with the specific condition in the first pregnancy. We first considered preterm birth in all weeks as a single group and then dichotomised into early preterm (20-33 weeks) and late preterm (34-36 weeks). Outcomes in this âreverseâ analysis were the same five complications (term pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, stillbirth, neonatal death, and small for gestational age), now in second pregnancies. The denominator for neonatal mortality in second pregnancies was restricted to live births. All analyses used first pregnancies ending in term delivery as the reference group.

      "      <p>In this large, population based registry study, women with complications or poor outcomes in a first birth at term were at substantially increased risk of preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Term complications included pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, stillbirth, neonatal death, and small for gestational age. Relative risks for preterm birth were twofold to fourfold higher after these term complications. The presence of one term complication was associated with a twofold higher risk of subsequent preterm birth, whereas two or more complications were associated with a 3.5-fold higher risk. For comparison, the recurrence of preterm birth in this population was fivefold.</p>\n",
      "      <p>The largest increase in relative risk of preterm birth was seen for births in the very preterm period (weeks 28-30) (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f3\">fig 3</xref> and eTable 2). Similarly, the reverse analysis showed that early preterm birth (20-33 weeks) in the first pregnancy was most strongly associated with an increased risk of term complications in a subsequent pregnancy. These unadjusted results (<xref rid=\"tbl2\" ref-type=\"table\">table 2</xref>) support a hypothesis of shared pathways linking term complications and preterm birth. The consistent associations across a wide range of term complications suggest the presence of maternal specific factors that predispose them to these outcomes. Our adjustments for known demographic and lifestyle factors had little influence on these associations, pointing towards more fundamental shared conditions such as a maternal propensity to placental dysfunction. The likely presence of maternal specific factors is further supported by the persistence of the associations among women who change their partner between first and second pregnancies.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Our results from the most recent period (1999-2015) were consistently stronger than results from earlier periods. This might reflect changes over time in clinical practice. However, if medical interventions explained our observations of increased risk of preterm birth after term complications, we would expect to see a greater increased risk in gestational weeks 34-36. Instead, we found that risks were more strongly increased during earlier weeks of gestation. Furthermore, the observed increases in risk of preterm birth were seen with all modes of delivery; spontaneous as well as iatrogenic preterm birth.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Improvements in data recording could have contributed to stronger associations over time. For example, the association between pre-eclampsia in a term first pregnancy and preterm birth in the second pregnancy increased from 1.3 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.5) in 1967-82 to 2.0 (1.8 to 2.1) in 1999-2014, when registration of pre-eclampsia was improved. Overall improvements in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway from 1998 might have reduced misclassification and strengthened some of the other associations. Also, reductions in other causal factors might help to expose the underlying associations reported here. For example, smoking has become much less common, and the rates of stillbirth and neonatal mortality have steadily declined.</p>\n",
      "      <p>The exact nature of the shared factors remains unclear. The possibilities of shared pathways linking these outcomes has been called to attention by the concepts of âgreat obstetrical syndromesâ<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>\n",

A few suggestions of such associations are found throughout the literature, specifically for pre-eclampsia and stillbirths. For the other outcomes we could find no comparable literature.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Pre-eclampsia is the only complication for which we have found similar findings to ours in the literatureâalthough even here, the studies are few.

We found that the associations strengthened over time (supplementary eTable 5) and the relative risk for preterm birth was still increased when restricting to a second spontaneous preterm birth (supplementary eTable 4). One study considered the reverse association with pre-eclampsia. Rasmussen et al reported that preterm birth in a first pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of term pre-eclampsia in the second pregnancy.<xref rid=\"ref31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref> Another Norwegian study assessed the reverse association of stillbirth in a pregnancy at term after a previous preterm birth, again with results similar to ours.<xref rid=\"ref32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>\n",

In particular, more women are estimated to have pre-eclampsia than are recorded in the birth registry.<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref> To the extent that women in our comparison group have unrecorded complications, our main results might be biased towards the null.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Strengths of the study include population based birth data, linking each mother with all her pregnancies. Prospectively recorded events minimise recall bias. The large dataset makes it possible to study relatively rare outcomes with precision. By restricting our analysis to first and second births, we limited the influence of selection, since 80% of women in Norway continue to a second pregnancy. At the same time, our restriction to this relatively unselected group of women makes it more difficult to extrapolate to third or later pregnancies.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Our findings are based on women in a country with universal free and accessible healthcare. The relatively homogeneous Norwegian population and its strong public support systems might limit the generalisability of these findings. Notably, although the preterm birth rate is around 6% in Norway, the corresponding rate is close to 9% in the rest of Europe and close to 10% in the United States.<xref rid=\"ref34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref> In a more heterogeneous population with greater income and health disparities the shared factors resulting in poor outcomes across pregnancies would presumably include a wider array of structural and social causes, with less opportunity to observe underlying biological propensities.</p>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref> the risk remains high and a large need exists for new treatments that lower the risk of kidney failure. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of glucose lowering drugs that also reduce blood pressure, body weight, and albuminuria. Large clinical trials have shown that these drugs have beneficial effects on renal outcomes. In the CREDENCE trial, patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease who received canagliflozin experienced lower rates of the composite renal outcome versus placebo, including end stage kidney disease, a doubling of serum creatinine concentration, and death from renal causes (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.81).<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref> Similarly, rates of composite renal outcomes were reduced among patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk receiving canagliflozin in the CANVAS programme (hazard ratio 0.58, 0.50 to 0.67),<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref> empagliflozin in the EMPAREG OUTCOME trial (0.61, 0.53 to 0.70),<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref> and dapagliflozin in the DECLARE TIMI-58 trial (0.53, 0.43 to 0.66).<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\n",

      "      <p>The data from clinical trials provide evidence for the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, but uncertainty remains about the effect of these drugs on renal outcomes in routine clinical practice.

The date of filling the first prescription constituted cohort entry. Exclusion criteria were previously filled prescriptions for any of the study drugs within two years of cohort entry, no specialist care contact or prescription drug in the previous year, history of dialysis or renal transplantation, end stage illness, drug misuse, severe pancreatic disorders, and hospital admission for any reason within 30 days before cohort entry (supplementary table B).</p>\n",
      "        <p>Using logistic regression, we estimated the probability of starting a SGLT2 inhibitor versus a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, conditional on the status of 57 covariates at cohort entry; the score included variables on sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, co-medications, and healthcare utilisation (supplementary table C). We used missing categories to handle missing data on place of birth (&lt;1%), civil status (&lt;1%), and education (&lt;3%)<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>; none of the other variables had missing data.

Supplementary table E shows ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, version 10) codes and procedure codes used to define the outcomes.

Patients were censored at the time of the first outcome event in the analyses of the primary outcome; in analyses of secondary outcomes, patients were censored at the first occurrence of the outcome analysed, independent of other outcomes. We used an intention to treat exposure definition in which patients were defined as being exposed to the study drug from cohort entry throughout follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazards regression with time since cohort entry as the time scale to estimate hazard ratios. We examined the assumption of proportional hazards by using a Wald test of the interaction between treatment status and time. We considered hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals that did not overlap 1 to be statistically significant. We estimated the absolute rate difference assuming a Poisson distribution.</p>\n",
      "        <p>For the primary outcome, we did subgroup analyses by sex, age group, history of major cardiovascular disease (supplementary table F), and history of chronic kidney disease. We used an interaction term between treatment status and subgroup to assess effect modification by subgroup status; in these analyses, we considered a P value below 0.05 to be statistically significant. We also analysed the primary outcome by country to assess consistency across data sources and in separate analyses for patients starting empagliflozin and dapagliflozin (and their 1:1 matched users of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors), respectively; this analysis was not possible for canagliflozin, as few patients used this drug.</p>\n",
      "        <p>In an additional analysis, we used an as-treated exposure definition based on the estimated duration of the filled prescriptions (supplementary table A), allowing for a 30 day grace period to account for prescription overlap, irregular drug use, and events that occurred shortly after treatment cessation. In these analyses, patients were censored at treatment cessation and crossover to the other study drug (that is, start of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors among users of SGLT2 inhibitors and vice versa).</p>\n",
      "        <p>We did several sensitivity analyses. Firstly, we adjusted the analysis of the primary outcome for calendar year of cohort entry. Next, in analyses in each of the propensity score matched cohorts in Sweden and Denmark, we adjusted the Cox models for additional variables. In Sweden, these variables included glycated haemoglobin level, blood pressure, albuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, body mass index, and smoking; in Denmark, they included glycated haemoglobin level, albuminuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (supplementary table G). Owing to the proportion of patients with missing data for these variables (supplementary table G), we used multiple imputation (fully conditional specification imputation) to handle missing data and used 10 imputed datasets for the analyses.<xref rid=\"ref17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref> On the basis of the imputed datasets, we also did the analyses in subgroups of patients by level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (&lt;60 <italic>v</italic> â¥60 per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area) and the presence of albuminuria. For these analyses, we estimated hazard ratios separately for each subgroup in each country and combined them using meta-analysis assuming fixed effects.</p>\n",

For this outcome, we observed a hazard ratio of 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.47) for use of SGLT2 inhibitors versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, which is broadly in line with the hazard ratio versus placebo for renal replacement therapy in the EMPAREG OUTCOME trial of empagliflozin (0.45, 0.21 to 0.97)<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref> and for end stage kidney disease in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial of dapagliflozin (0.31, 0.13 to 0.79),<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref> whereas the hazard ratio for end stage kidney disease in the CREDENCE trial of canagliflozin was slightly higher (0.68, 0.54 to 0.86).<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref> Dapagliflozin (66.1% of the total follow-up time among users of SGLT2 inhibitors) and empagliflozin (32.6%) were the most common SGLT2 inhibitors in our study population, but use of canagliflozin was rare (1.3%). With respect to event rates, the incidence of renal replacement therapy was substantially higher in the CREDENCE trial (13.3 (canagliflozin) versus 17.7 (placebo) per 1000 person years) than in our study (0.8 (SGLT2 inhibitors) versus 2.5 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors) per 1000 person years), in which event rates were similar to those of the EMPAREG OUTCOME trial (1.0 (emplagliflozin) versus 2.1 (placebo) per 1000 person years). Whereas the CREDENCE trials included patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to less than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and albuminuria, SGLT2 inhibitors were used in a broad range of patients in routine clinical practice, although these drugs were not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> during the study period.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We attempted to limit the risk of confounding by using a propensity score including a wide range of patient characteristics. Moreover, we used a new user design excluding patients with a history of using any of the study drugs at cohort entry; this design removed the possibility of immortal time bias, which has been highlighted in other observational analyses of SGLT2 inhibitors.<xref rid=\"ref21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref> Another strength of the study was the use of data on glycated haemoglobin level, albuminuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (Sweden and Denmark), as well as blood pressure, body mass index, and smoking (Sweden) in the Swedish and Danish parts of the cohort (78.5% of the overall cohort). When the outcome models were further adjusted for these variables in sensitivity analyses, the point estimate for the primary outcome moved from 0.41 to 0.50 in Sweden and from 0.42 to 0.55 in Denmark, indicating that the primary analyses may present slightly overestimated associations owing to confounding by these variables.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We used DPP4 inhibitors as the active comparator drug class to mitigate the risk of confounding by indication, disease severity, and unmeasured clinical characteristics. During the study period, both dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors were recommended as second or third line glucose lowering drugs, and the two drug classes were thus used in similar clinical situations and at a similar stage of disease.<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> In accordance with their neutral effect on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, data from clinical trials in patients at high cardiovascular risk indicate that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have no or limited effects on renal outcomes.<xref rid=\"ref12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref> The risk of composite renal outcomes was similar among patients receiving active treatment and placebo in the SAVOR TIMI 53 trial of saxagliptin and the CARMELINA trial of linagliptin,<xref rid=\"ref22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref> although some potential benefit was indicated in exploratory analyses of albuminuria outcomes.<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref> In the EXAMINE trial, the risks of dialysis and changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate were similar in patients receiving alogliptin and placebo.<xref rid=\"ref25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref> In the TECOS trial of sitagliptin, which comprised 64.8% of the DPP4 inhibitor use in our study, the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate was clinically similar in patients receiving active treatment and placebo.<xref rid=\"ref26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref> If dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have a protective effect on renal outcomes, the associations observed in our study may represent an underestimation of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. However, this would not change the overall interpretation of our analyses, and the study would still present a head-to-head comparative effectiveness analysis of SGLT2 inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Furthermore, comparative effectiveness analyses of other drug classes with demonstrated renoprotective effects,<xref rid=\"ref12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref> such as glucagon-like peptide-1-receptor-agonists, remain a topic for future investigation.</p>\n",

      "        <p>Our study has limitations. Firstly, the definition of exposure was based on filled prescriptions; low adherence may bias the results towards the null. Secondly, the study was conducted in Scandinavia, and its generalisability to other populations and healthcare systems is unknown. Thirdly, although high sensitivity and positive predictive values have been observed for procedure codes and diagnoses recorded in Scandinavian health registers,<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref> data on covariates and outcomes in these registers may be incomplete or misclassified.

      "<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref> Outcome misclassification could have introduced bias in our analyses; however, such misclassification is not likely to be different in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Finally, although we used an active comparator, new user design and estimated a propensity score to control for a large number of patient characteristics, this was an observational study and the risk of unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out.</p>\n",

During 900â214 person years of follow-up, 3540 cases of incident stroke were identified, of which 63.0% (n=2230) were ischemic and 27.5% (n=973) were hemorrhagic. Compared with the first quarter of exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> (&lt;54.5 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup>), participants in the highest quarter (&gt;78.2 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup>) had an increased risk of incident stroke (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 1.74), ischemic stroke (1.82, 1.55 to 2.14), and hemorrhagic stroke (1.50, 1.16 to 1.93). For each increase of 10 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup> in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration, the increased risks of incident stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke were 13% (1.13, 1.09 to 1.17), 20% (1.20, 1.15 to 1.25), and 12% (1.12, 1.05 to 1.20), respectively. Almost linear exposure-response relations between long term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and incident stroke, overall and by its subtypes, were observed.</p>\n",

Overall, no substantial changes occurred in the effect estimates of PM<sub>2.5</sub> across the various analyses. When further adjustment was made for the county level averaged years of education, the effect estimates were 1.15 (1.11 to 1.19) for total stroke, 1.24 (1.18 to 1.30) for ischemic stroke, and 1.13 (1.06 to 1.21) for hemorrhagic stroke. When using annual mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations as time-varying exposures or baseline two year average PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels as long term exposures in the Cox model, similar associations with the main analyses were obtained. Exclusion of the China MUCA (1992-94) subcohort did not substantially influence the results. Furthermore, in the analysis with smoking pack year history considered in the three subcohorts with available information on smoking dose, the associations between PM<sub>2.5</sub> level and incident stroke were observed to be not significantly different from those fitted using model 3. Adjustment for baseline diabetes and total cholesterol levels did not substantially alter the results either. In addition, the results remained stable after excluding those with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease at baseline examination or when excluding those with incident stroke events occurring within the first year of follow-up.</p>\n",

In subgroup analysis, although the P values for effect modification were not statistically significant in most subgroups, we found suggestive evidence of stronger associations between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and incidence of ischemic stroke among elderly people and participants of normal body weight. These results were consistent with findings from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects project.<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref> Further experimental studies were needed to understand the interaction effects between exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and other risk factors in the development process of stroke.</p>\n",

      "        <p>Estimating exposure-response relations between long term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and risk of stroke is critical for assessing the burden of diseases and making public health policies. In the current study, we found almost linear exposure-response relations between PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration and stroke, overall and according to each subtype. The GBD Study, however, suggested a non-linear relationship between exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and stroke mortality, with steeper slopes at lower exposures, which level off at higher exposures.<xref rid=\"ref3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref> To consider the shape of exposure-response curves at high ambient concentrations, the Global Burden of Disease Study integrated risk estimates from studies in high income countries with lower ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels, as well as effect estimates for high concentrations derived from studies of household solid cooking fuel, secondhand smoke, and active smoking.<xref rid=\"ref39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref> This method was proposed without considering the variations in PM<sub>2.5</sub> toxicity across different pollution sources (eg, ambient air pollution versus smoking), which may have influenced the effect estimates.<xref rid=\"ref39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>\n",

First, we used data from large population based prospective cohorts with long follow-up and high quality outcome assessments. Second, our study participants were widely distributed across China, covering a wide range of geographic PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels, from 31.2 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup> to 97.0 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup>, which presented a valuable opportunity to assess exposure-response relations. Third, we used an advanced satellite based spatiotemporal model with high accuracy to estimate ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels at 1Ã1 km resolution, which ensured accurate exposure assessment. Fourth, we collected data on multiple cardiovascular risk factors at the individual level, which allowed us to better control for potential confounders.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Some limitations of our study should be noted. First, we did not consider other air pollutants, meteorological factors, and environmental noise in our statistical models, because high quality and high resolution exposure estimates were unavailable. Second, we did not collect data around indoor air pollution sources such as household use of solid fuels. Third, we estimated exposures to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> at the participantsâ residential address without considering their daily activities and location, which could result in misclassification of exposure. Indoor sources of air pollution and individual time-activity patterns are currently being collected and we will consider them in future analyses. Fourth, considering the limited statistical power, we did not perform analyses on subtypes of ischemic stroke.</p>\n",

Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.

      "      <p>Coronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe and even fatal respiratory infections. In the past two decades two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov) and the coronavirus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-Cov),<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref> have emerged in two separate events. They induced lower respiratory tract infection as well as extrapulmonary manifestations, leading to hundreds or thousands of cases with high mortality rates of up to 50% in certain populations. In December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus, officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), was first isolated from three patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention,<xref rid=\"ref3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref> connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases from Wuhan, China. Recent epidemiological reports have provided evidence for person to person transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 in family and hospital settings.<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref> As of 28 February 2020, the number of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 has exceeded 83â652 globally, and more than 2858 have now died of covid-19, with the highest mortality rate of 4.47% in Wuhan. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 constituted a public health emergency of international concern.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Evidence indicates that substantial similarities exist between severe acute respiratory syndrome and covid-19. A recent study reported a 79.5% genome sequence identity between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov, and SARS-Cov-2 was 96% identical in terms of whole genome sequence to a bat coronavirus.<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref> Clinical and pathological features of patients with covid-19 have recently been reported, showing that the SARS-Cov-2 infection causes clusters of severe and even fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling that of SARS-Cov infection, associated with admission to intensive care units and high mortality.<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref> The first study of the initial 41 laboratory confirmed cases with covid-19 showed that 28 (68%) of 41 patients had been discharged and six (15%) had died.<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref> A larger case series involving 138 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 showed that 47 (34%) patients were discharged and six died (overall mortality 4.3%).<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological differences between patients who were and were not admitted to the intensive care unit have been fully evaluated. Given that the numbers of patients in these studies is relatively small, information about the clinical characteristics of patients who died is scarce. No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 has yet been shown to be effective, so supportive therapy that eases the symptoms and protects multi-organ function may be beneficial. Identifying or more promptly treating patients in high risk groups is crucial to decrease the mortality rate.</p>\n",
      "      <p>In this study, we did a comprehensive evaluation of deceased patients and patients recovered among those with confirmed covid-19 who were previously transferred or admitted to the isolation ward of Wuhan Tongji Hospital, which is one of the designated hospitals assigned by Chinese government for patients severely or critically ill with covid-19. We aimed to compare the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of patients with different clinical outcomes.</p>\n",

Tongji Hospital was urgently reconstructed and has been assigned by Chinese government as a designed hospital for severely or critically ill patients with covid-19. As of 28 February 2020, 113 of the 799 patients had died, with a mortality rate of up to 14.1%, and 161 patients had recovered and been discharged. The remaining 525 patients were still in hospital and receiving medical care. All patients were diagnosed as having covid-19 and classified as being moderately, severely, or critically ill according to the Guidance for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (6th edition) released by the National Health Commission of China.<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref> All the recovered patients with covid-19 had completely resolved symptoms and signs, had significant improvement in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and no longer needed supportive care, with confirmed viral clearance by repeated tests for SARS-Cov-2 before hospital discharge. Written informed consent was waived owing to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We obtained epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as treatment and outcome data, from electronic medical records for deceased patients and recovered patients by using data collection forms. We collected data on demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying chronic diseases, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans of the chest, and treatment (including antiviral therapy, antibiotics, corticosteroid therapy, and oxygen support) during the hospital admission. The clinical data were monitored up to 28 February 2020. The research team of experienced clinicians from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology analysed patientsâ medical records. A trained team of physicians and researchers independently entered and cross checked data in a computerised database. If the core data were missing, we sent requests for clarification to the coordinators, who subsequently contacted the clinicians responsible for the treatment of the patients. As some patients presented with various forms of disorder of consciousness on admission, we obtained data on their medical histories and pre-admission information through contact with their close relatives and by accessing medical records from previous hospital visits.</p>\n",

After standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifuged at 1000 revolutions per minute for five minutes. The suspension was used for real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Two target genesâopen reading frame 1ab (<italic>ORF1ab</italic>) and nucleocapsid protein (N)âwere simultaneously amplified and tested during the real time RT-PCR assay. Target 1 (<italic>ORF1ab</italic>) comprised forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA, reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA, and the probe 5â²-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3â². Target 2 (N) comprised forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT, reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG, and the probe 5â²-FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3â². The real time RT-PCR assay was conducted using a SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturerâs protocol (Shanghai Bio-germ Medical Technology company). The reaction mixture contains 12 Î¼L of reaction buffer, 4 Î¼L of enzyme solution, 4 Î¼L of Probe primers solution, 3 Î¼L of diethyl pyrocarbonate treated water, and 2 Î¼L of RNA template. The RT-PCR assay was conducted under the following conditions: incubation at 50Â°C for 15 minutes and 95Â°C for five minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94Â°C for 15 seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55Â°C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a cycle threshold value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html\">http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html</ext-link>). A medium load, defined as a cycle threshold value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting.</p>\n",

      "        <p>From 13 January to 12 February 2020, 799 moderately to severely ill or critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 were transferred or admitted to Tongji Hospital. As of 28 February 2020, 113 of these patients had died of covid-19 and 161 patients had fully recovered and been discharged. As shown in <xref rid=\"tbl1\" ref-type=\"table\">table 1</xref>, the median age of deceased patients was 68 (interquartile range 62.0-77.0) years, which was significantly older than recovered patients (51 (37.0-66.0) years); 94 (83%) deceased patients and 59 (37%) who recovered were aged 60 or older. Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Overall, 71 (63%) patients who died and 62 (39%) who recovered had at least one chronic medical condition. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease were much more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%), 16 (14%), and 4 (4%)) than among recovered patients (39 (24%), 7 (4%), and 0 (0%)). Few patients had a current or former cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack years. The proportion of healthcare workers among deceased patients (1; 1%) was significantly lower than among recovered patients (18; 11%). Likewise, the proportion of patients with a history of close contact with previously confirmed patients tended to be lower in deceased patients (44; 12%) than in recovered patients (33; 20%).</p>\n",

Other prevalent symptoms at onset of illness in deceased patients included fatigue, dyspnoea, chest tightness, and sputum production; less common symptoms included anorexia, diarrhoea, and myalgia. Dyspnoea and chest tightness were much more common in deceased patients (70 (62%) and 55 (49%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%) and 48 (30%)). Twenty five (22%) people who died and only one (1%) who recovered had disorders of consciousness on hospital admission. Nine deceased patients and 16 who recovered had no fever, with fatigue, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, or diarrhoea as the initial symptoms.

These were significantly more frequent than in recovered patients, showing their potential association with the clinical outcome. Less common complications in deceased patients included acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute liver injury. One patient who died developed gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to develop acute cardiac injury and heart failure.

The median age of deceased patients was significantly older than that of recovered patients. Male sex was more predominant in patients who died than in those who recovered. Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients than recovered patients. Symptoms related to hypoxemia were more common in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Deceased patients more often developed systematic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction than did recovered patients.

      "        <title>Comparison with other studies</title>\n",
      "        <p>The clinical spectrum of covid-19 varies widely, ranging from an asymptomatic infection to severe and critical pneumonia with high fatality rates. The Chinese Centers for Disease Control recently reported that most of the confirmed cases were classified as mild or moderate, 13.8% as severe, and only 4.7% as critically ill.<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> The overall fatality rate for confirmed covid-19 cases was found to be higher in male than in female patients, with the risk of death rising with age for both sexes. The highest fatality rate was in people aged 80 and above.</p>\n",
      "        <p>The overall mortality rate of covid-19 is much lower than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (10%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (30%).<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> However, covid-19 has ultimately proven more deadly as it has spread to many more people globally than did the others, owing to rapid person to person transmission and atypical symptoms at an early stage in certain patients.<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> Here, we report a relatively high mortality rate for covid-19 of up to 14.1%, which is higher than in recent reports.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> This is partly due to a large proportion of severely or critically ill patients admitted to Tongji Hospital, one of the designated hospitals for severe covid-19, and to the medical resource limitations at the beginning of the covid-19 outbreak. These resources were improved by early February, with prompt supply of medics and medical necessities from across the nation to Wuhan. </p>\n",
      "        <p>In accordance with the recent reports on characteristics of patients with covid-19 who needed management in intensive care units,<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref> advanced age (&gt;60), male sex, and comorbidities (particularly hypertension) are believed to be risk factors for severe disease and death from SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thus, early vigilant monitoring along with high quality supportive care are needed in patients at high risk. It is notable that healthcare workers as well as close contacts of previously confirmed patients were likely to have a good outcome, which is consistent with the relatively low fatality rate (0.3%) reported in healthcare workers.<xref rid=\"ref18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref> This could be explained by the fact that in our study the median age of the healthcare workers was much younger than that of the remaining patients (data not shown). It could also be partly due to the lower mortality observed in the second generation of SARS-Cov-2 infection,<xref rid=\"ref19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref> as well as to the early awareness of potential infection in that scenario meaning that people would seek medical care or start treatment promptly. Furthermore, the time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was longer in deceased patients, as some of them had been in a critical condition before being transferred from other healthcare units to Tongji Hospital. This highlights the need to develop community awareness about prompt seeking of medical care and earlier referral to the intensive care unit for high risk populations.</p>\n",
      "        <p>The incidence of symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, anorexia, myalgia, and diarrhoea did not differ significantly between deceased patients and recovered patients, whereas dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorders of consciousness were more common in those who died. Moreover, the vital signs data showed that most deceased patients had tachycardia and/or tachypnoea as well as pulse oxygen saturation of 93% or lower. These signs and symptoms indicated that most deceased patients had been in a severe or critical condition on admission, and the onset of certain symptoms may help physicians to identify the patients at risk of a poor outcome.</p>\n",
      "        <p>The differences in abnormalities of laboratory findings between the deceased patients and the survivors were substantial. Most of the deceased patients and only a few recovered patients developed leukocytosis, and one third of deceased patients and only few who recovered had procalcitonin above 0.5 ng/mL, indicating that a large proportion of deceased patients might have had secondary bacterial infection, which could be strongly associated with death. Deceased patients had persistent and more severe lymphopenia compared with recovered patients, suggesting that a cellular immune deficiency state was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, other common laboratory abnormalities in deceased patients included coagulation disorder (elevation of prothrombin time and D-dimer), impaired liver and kidney function (mild or moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine and frequent hypoalbuminaemia, haematuria, and albuminuria), electrolyte disturbance (hyperkalaemia and hypernatraemia), elevated inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, ferritin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and cytokine storm. Most notably, markedly higher concentrations of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were seen in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Increase in cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was much more frequent and significant than that in the recent reports,<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> likely owing to the relatively small number of deceased patients and more patients at earlier stages of the disease included in those studies.</p>\n",
      "        <p>In the later stages of the disease, patients who die may develop pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ damage, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, type I respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, heart failure, acute kidney injury, hypoxic encephalopathy, shock, acidosis or alkalosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute liver injury, although the last two complications were less frequent. Development of respiratory, cardiac, and neurological complications is strongly associated with poor outcome in patients with covid-19. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Cardiac complications were frequent not only in deceased patients with cardiovascular comorbidities but also in those without cardiovascular comorbidities, suggesting that the high risk of cardiac complications in deceased patients could not be entirely ascribed to coexisting cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure could be major factors contributing to the fatality risk of covid-19 regardless of history of previous cardiovascular disease. However, the pathological report of covid-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome at present shows that pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation in the lungs, but no obvious histological changes in heart tissue, was identified from one single case report.<xref rid=\"ref20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref> This suggests that the underlying mechanism of cardiac injury needs further exploration. The median time from onset of symptoms to death in deceased patients was 16 days, and the median time from first symptoms to discharge in recovered patients was 26 days. In covid-19, the evolution of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in the first two weeks may determine the physiological progression (resolving or progressing) and outcome of disease (death or survival).</p>\n",
      "        <p>To date, no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 has proven to be effective, so supportive therapy that eases the symptoms and protects important organs may be most beneficial. In this study, for patients without second bacterial infection, empirical antimicrobial treatment seemed to be ineffective. Fewer deceased patients than recovered received antiviral monotherapy or combination antiviral therapy, as well as interferon Î± inhalation treatment. Considering the severe pneumonia and âcytokine stormâ observed in deceased patients, more of these patients were given glucocorticoid therapy than recovered patients. Because of hypoxaemia, significantly more deceased patients than recovered received ventilation. We cannot conclude from this study which antivirals given at the right time would be beneficial, or whether steroid use would be beneficial, for patients with covid-19; further investigation is needed.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Substantial similarities exist between covid-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome, from the virus homology to the potential origin, main transmission route (respiratory droplets), identified receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), clinical manifestation, and disease dynamics.<xref rid=\"ref21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref> Risk factors for severe covid-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome outcomes are old age and comorbidities. Progression for patients with severe disease follows a similar pattern for both viruses.<xref rid=\"ref21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref> Although both viruses can cause severe and even lethal lower respiratory tract infection and extrapulmonary manifestations, myocardial injury and heart failure are more frequently reported in patients with covid-19, indicating a unique pathophysiology.<xref rid=\"ref22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref> These findings will alert clinicians to pay special attention not only to the development of respiratory dysfunction but also to the signs of cardiac complications.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Limitations of study</title>\n",
      "        <p>Our study has several limitations. Firstly, almost all the deceased patients were classified as being severely or critically ill, whereas a large proportion of recovered patients might be classified as having moderate disease. This patient setting reflects the real world situation where most confirmed cases are mild or moderate. Nevertheless, the high incidence of cardiac complications in deceased patients is of great importance, raising awareness of the need for earlier monitoring and cardiac supportive care. Secondly, nearly a third of deceased patients developed disorders of consciousness on admission, ranging from somnolence to deep coma, which may result in a loss of some information (particularly a detailed history and subjective symptoms). Additionally, some laboratory tests (for example, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and arterial blood gas tests) were not done in all the patients, and missing data or important tests might lead to bias of clinical characteristics. Thirdly, the median length of hospital admission before death was about five days, information on the dynamic changes in laboratory variables in deceased patients was lacking, and the data collected for each patient on admission may have been from different disease stages. Therefore, further study is warranted to gain a better understanding of risk factors for and outcome of covid-19, which ultimately may help to guide efforts aimed at reducing the fatality rate.</p>\n",

In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and type I respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure may also contribute to the critical illness state associated with high mortality, which highlights the importance of earlier cardiac monitoring and supportive care in such patients.</p>\n",

      "          <p>This study included 10â500 manuscripts published in 2105 journals. Overall, 71.2% (7473/10500) reported the TRN and 41.7% (3013/7218) complied with prospective trial registration. The univariable and multivariable analyses reported significant relations (P&lt;0.05) between reporting the TRN and the impact factor and ICMJE membership of the publishing journal. A significant relation (P&lt;0.05) was also observed between prospective trial registration and the registry, region, condition, funding, trial size, interval between paper registration and submission dates, impact factor, and ICMJE membership of the publishing journal. A manuscript published in an ICMJE member journal was 5.8 times more likely to include the TRN (odds ratio 5.8, 95% confidence interval 4.0 to 8.2), and a published trial was 1.8 times more likely to be registered prospectively (1.8, 1.5 to 2.2) when published in an ICMJE member journal compared with other journals. This study detected a new form of bias, selective registration bias, with a higher proportion (85.2% (616/723)) of trials registered retrospectively within a year of submission for publication. Higher rates of retrospective registrations were observed within the first three to eight weeks after enrolment of study participants. Within the 286 RCTs registered retrospectively and published in an ICMJE member journal, only 2.8% (8/286) of the authors included a statement justifying the delayed registration. Reasons included lack of awareness, error of omission, and the registration process taking longer than anticipated.</p>\n",

To support this hypothesis, we found that US based trials were more likely to be registered within the first three weeks after enrolment compared with international trials, with the assumption that US based RCTs would adhere more to the FDA requirements.</p>\n",

Of the retrospectively registered trials in the ISRCTN registry, 70.9% were registered before the end of the enrolment date and were more likely to be published in a high impact journal.

Perhaps the definition of prospective trial registration based on registering the trial before data collection would be more meaningful. However, we foresee a few challenges with this definition. Firstly, it requires schema modifications to the WHO trial registration dataset to include a dedicated and mandatory start date field for data collection. Secondly, the primary outcome might not be captured within a predefined time point for all study subjectsâfor example, surgery related trials or trials with outcomes measured by frequency of relapses or episodes. Thirdly, it does not preclude the bias for modification of the trial registration record after enrolment that might be driven by other factors, such as feasibly of recruitment, resources, and pre-intervention baseline measures.<xref rid=\"ref38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>\n",

The risk of suicide increased by 13% in the period after the media reported a death of a celebrity by suicide (rate ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.18; 14 studies; median follow-up 28 days, range 7-60 days). When the suicide method used by the celebrity was reported, there was an associated 30% increase in deaths by the same method (rate ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.44; 11 studies; median follow-up 28 days, range 14-60 days). For general reporting of suicide, the rate ratio was 1.002 (0.997 to 1.008; five studies; median follow-up 1 day, range 1-8 days) for a one article increase in the number of reports on suicide. Heterogeneity was large and partially explained by celebrity and methodological factors. Enhanced funnel plots suggested some publication bias in the literature.</p>\n",

      "          <p>Reporting of deaths of celebrities by suicide appears to have made a meaningful impact on total suicides in the general population. The effect was larger for increases by the same method as used by the celebrity. General reporting of suicide did not appear to be associated with suicide although associations for certain types of reporting cannot be excluded. The best available intervention at the population level to deal with the harmful effects of media reports is guidelines for responsible reporting. These guidelines should be more widely implemented and promoted, especially when reporting on deaths of celebrities by suicide.</p>\n",

The guidelines also recommend including information on the role of treatable mental illness, where and how to seek help for suicidal thoughts, and a message of hope that suicide is preventable.

      "      <p>The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine and quantify the findings from the literature on the Werther effect. We aimed to evaluate the effects of three types of media reporting on suicide on the subsequent incidence of suicide. The primary objective was to summarise the evidence on the association of media reporting of deaths of celebrities by suicide on total suicides over a short period of time (up to two months). The secondary objectives were to summarise the association of media reporting of information about the specific methods used by the celebrities on suicides by the same method, and the association of general reporting of suicide on the total number of suicides. We hypothesised that reporting of the deaths of celebrities by suicide would be associated with an increased incidence of suicide in the general population, and that increases by the same method would be strongest. We did not have a clear hypothesis for general reporting of suicide because of the variety of content, some of which might be harmful and some protective.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>\n",

      "        <p>Studies were considered at low risk of bias if all domains were coded as low risk; at moderate risk if at least one domain was coded moderate but none as serious; at serious risk if at least one domain was assessed as serious but none as critical; and at critical risk if any domain was coded as critical. Like an earlier study that applied the Robins-I tool to natural experiments,<xref rid=\"ref30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref> we found that the first domain, risk of bias as a result of confounding, generally determined the overall risk of bias. This domain comprised coding for subdomains if the number of pre-intervention times was sufficient to allow characterisation of the series; appropriate analysis techniques were used to account for time trends and time patterns; seasonality was accounted for; and possible confounders were measured and controlled for. Risk of bias because of selective reporting was also relevant for some studies. We assessed if the outcome measurement and analyses were clearly defined and consistent in the methods and results sections of the studies, and if there was some risk of selective reporting from multiple analysis methods, multiple follow-up times, or multiple subgroups. The full quality assessment plan is in the supplementary appendix.</p>\n",

Studies at critical risk of bias were excluded. Assessments of the risk of bias were based only on the data we abstracted. If the authors provided a reanalysis of their data, for example, only the reanalysis was assessed for risk of bias, not the original study. Similarly, if a study reported total suicides as a side outcome, only the components relevant to the abstracted data (total suicides) were assessed. Our quality ratings, therefore, do not always apply to the original studies. Risk of bias was assessed independently by TN and MJS, and discrepancies were discussed and resolved.</p>\n",

After screening the titles and abstracts, the full texts of 143 studies were assessed and 112 were excluded: 26 because suicide was not an outcome; 30 because of strong data duplication with other studies; 17 because the intervention (media story) was not about suicide; 19 because of reports on emerging suicide methods; five because suicide was analysed only in a population subgroup; and five had data from before the end of the second world war. Also excluded were: two case studies; two studies measuring the outcome for longer than the maximum follow-up; one study about a fictional intervention; and two studies with annual outcome data. After quality assessment, three studies were excluded because of a critical risk of bias. The remaining 31 studies were included in our review: 23 were from database searches, three from Google Scholar, and five from cross reference searches.</p>\n",

The 31 studies were published between 1974 and 2019 and examined the period 1947 to 2016. Nineteen studies examined the total number of suicides as the outcome and two examined increases in suicides by the same method reported in the media; 10 studies reported both. Twenty two studies examined media reporting of deaths of celebrities by suicide and nine studies evaluated general reporting of suicide. Studies were from Asia (Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan), Europe (Austria, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovenia, France, and Israel), North America (United States and Canada), and Australia. Most studies (n=20) used an interrupted time series design, 10 a multiple arm before-and-after design, and one a single arm before-and-after design. Seven studies had follow-up of 1-7 days, eight had 8-14 days, 12 had 15-30 days, and four had 31-60 days. The median follow-up time was 21 days (range 1-60 days).</p>\n",

      "        <p>To our knowledge, this systematic review and meta-analysis is the most comprehensive to date of the effects of media reporting of suicide on subsequent suicides. The evidence indicates an increase in total suicides in the period after the reporting of a death of a celebrity by suicide. When the suicide method used by the celebrity was reported, evidence of a corresponding increase in the number of suicides by the same method was found. This effect appeared to be larger than for increases in total suicides, although suicides by a specific method typically only account for a limited proportion of all suicides. General reporting of suicide did not appear to be associated with increases in total suicides but the evidence was based on a small number of studies, mainly from the same region of the world.</p>\n",
      "        <p>At least three mechanisms might explain the increases in the number of suicides associated with reporting of suicide: identification with the deceased person, which might occur more frequently when the reported suicides are about individuals with high social standing<xref rid=\"ref37\" ref-type=\"bibr\">37</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>; increased media reporting of suicide leading to normalisation of suicide as an acceptable way to cope with difficulties<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>; and information on suicide methods, which might influence the choice of suicide method by a vulnerable individual.<xref rid=\"ref38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref> Our findings support several of these mechanisms. Firstly, reporting on deaths of celebrities by suicide appears to increase total suicides, suggesting that the phenomenon goes beyond the influence of knowing the suicide method used by the celebrity. Secondly, some evidence exists of stronger effects in studies focusing on suicide by entertainers, compared with other celebrities, consistent with their strong public identity, which has been previously described for entertainment celebrities in particular.<xref rid=\"ref39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref> Studies that focused on increases in suicide after one (rather than several) suicide by a celebrity often reported on entertainers, suggesting that these celebrities were well known and of interest to the public. Thirdly, the finding of a pronounced increase in suicide by the same method as that of a celebrity suggests that transfer of information about the method might be another relevant factor in the association. Media reporting on a suicide method increases the cognitive availability of this method,<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref> and individuals considering suicide might be more likely to subsequently select the method used by celebrities. The evidence suggests that suicide by hanging, for example, especially among men aged 45-64 years, increased after the suicide of Robin Williams by the same method.<xref rid=\"ref36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>Support for the effect of media coverage of suicide also comes from individual level studies that typically used outcomes such as suicidal thoughts rather than suicidal behaviour. Harmful effects on mood, self-esteem, and suicidal thoughts, especially in those who have previously contemplated suicide, have been identified.<xref rid=\"ref40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref42\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref> Individuals with suicidal thoughts, particularly new thoughts and a suicide plan, have an increased risk of suicidal behaviour.<xref rid=\"ref43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref> The increases in total suicides, and greater increases in suicides by the same method reported in the media, as identified in our meta-analysis, suggest that media stories on deaths of celebrities by suicide might do both: increase suicidal thoughts and contribute to planning suicide with a specific method. Suicidal thoughts are a common occurrence. A recent survey in the United States estimated that 9.4 million adults (4% of the population) had seriously considered taking their own life in the previous 12 months, and 2.7 million (1% of the population) made plans to do so,<xref rid=\"ref44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref> suggesting media reports of suicide have the potential to negatively influence many vulnerable people who might be swayed by news items.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We found that the size of the association for suicides after the reporting of deaths of celebrities by suicide was smaller than in a previous meta-analysis that included fewer studies and did not assess the risk of bias comprehensively (based on 10 studies).<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref> Reasons for the smaller association might include the broader literature search, exclusion of duplicate data, and exclusion of studies at critical risk of bias. A rate ratio of 8-18% increase in suicide, however, highlights that media exposure relating to deaths of celebrities by suicide has a strong influence on the incidence of suicide in a population. In contrast, the global financial crisis of 2009 was associated with a 6% increase in suicide (although over a longer period of time).<xref rid=\"ref45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref> The estimated increase for reporting on deaths of celebrities by suicide might also underestimate the effects of media reporting on well known celebrities. Some of the studies included focused on individuals with questionable prominence, including mid-level or regional politicians and others not likely to be known by most of the population.<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> Estimates were higher for well known celebrities, such as Robin Williams. Unlike in fixed effects meta-analyses of drug trials in defined populations, no true single effect exists for the association of media reporting on suicide with the number of subsequent suicides. Associations will probably vary depending on factors such as the prominence of the person in the media reports, the populationâs connection with that person, and the extent to which the death is reported responsibly by the media in the region where the study is conducted. The World Health Organization has emphasised that media professionals should be cautious when reporting on suicides in general and on deaths of celebrities by suicide in particular.<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>For general reporting on suicide, taking into account all media reporting of suicide, no association with increases in the number of suicides was found. These studies usually evaluated the effect of the number of news articles on suicide on the next day or in the next week whereas studies of reporting on deaths of celebrities reported the presence or absence of a death of celebrity by suicide. The studies on general reporting of suicide also tended to use wide ranging search strategies to identify a broad variety of media reports related to suicide. This search strategy might have resulted in media reports associated with suicides but might have been distorted by inclusion of other reporting types that do not cause harm. Previous research suggests that not all reporting on suicide is associated with increases in the number of suicides.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> The risk appears to vary with reporting characteristics.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> Increases are particularly likely for a subset of media reporting that describes suicide methods<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>; depicts suicide as inevitable<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>; or publicises false public myths about suicide.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref> Some media reports on suicidal thoughts feature stories of hope and healing, rather than suicide attempts or deaths, and might help to prevent suicides (the so-called Papageno effect).<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref> None of the studies in our meta-analysis considered the qualities of media reports based on media recommendations, and the variability in reporting qualities is likely large. Hence, a resulting underestimation of the effects for media stories that are inconsistent with media recommendations is possible. Future research should aim for a clear definition of the reporting to separate associations for different types of reports.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Our meta-analysis generally took a conservative approach by limiting the analysis to studies at moderate risk of bias and focusing entirely on total suicides (rather than subgroups) as the outcome for the primary analysis. If, for example, a study reported on the effects of news media reporting on the incidence of suicide in teenagers, the data extracted for our meta-analysis were for the total population, even if the study put a focus on its specific findings for the subgroup of teenagers. This approach was to ensure that selective reporting of findings in subgroups did not bias our estimates.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Like previous reviews,<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> we found strong heterogeneity in risk estimates across studies on reporting of suicide by celebrities in particular. A large part of the heterogeneity was a result of the type of celebrity or number of celebrities analysed, suggesting that individuals best known to the public are those most likely to trigger more suicides. None of the characteristics explained the method specific increases in suicides. The remaining unexplained heterogeneity suggests that factors out of scope of our analysis might impact on the risk of increases in suicides after suicide reporting, including overall trends in the incidence of suicides in a country or over a period of time when media reporting occurs; socioeconomic conditions that might influence suicide reporting and imitation effects; and precise measurement of social identification with celebrities and other individuals who die by suicide.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We observed a number of significant and positive effect sizes and an absence of non-significant effect sizes in some regions of the funnel plots for studies of reporting on deaths of celebrities by suicide. This lack of symmetry could indicate publication bias. Many factors can contribute to asymmetry in funnel plots, however, and precise interpretation is difficult when the underlying evidence is based on observational data.<xref rid=\"ref48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref> Unpublished studies could have shown no association. If true, this means that our meta-analysis will have overestimated the association between media reporting of suicide by celebrities and subsequent suicides. A sensitivity analysis including studies with serious risk of bias indicated a similar pattern to the overall findings, suggesting that effect estimates for lower risk studies were similar.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Strengths and limitations</title>\n",
      "        <p>The strengths of our meta-analysis included its wide ranging systematic search strategy; screening of more studies than in previous quantitative meta-analyses on this topic; thorough check for duplicate data; and the comprehensive quality assessment of the primary studies. Our approach was intentionally conservative, focusing on studies with a low to moderate risk of bias and only with estimates related to total suicides in the population. This study also looks at the research on the effects of general reporting of suicide on subsequent numbers of suicides, although only five studies were available for this analysis. </p>\n",
      "        <p>Limitations included our inability to test causality because of the before-and-after and interrupted time series designs of the original studies, high levels of heterogeneity that could not be fully accounted for, and possible publication bias. Further, it was not possible to generate absolute risk estimates because the included studies mostly did not report the baseline risk of suicide in their respective settings. Despite the wide ranging search strategy, non-English language studies in the international literature might not have been indexed in the databases we searched. Our analysis covered only a proportion of suicide related media items. Studies on the effects of media items covering the spreading of novel suicide methods, such as charcoal burning in parts of Asia,<xref rid=\"ref50\" ref-type=\"bibr\">50</xref> were not included because of the low prevalence of these methods at baseline. Studies on fictional suicides were not included to avoid a further increase in heterogeneity between studies. Hence we cannot draw conclusions on these types of studies; our meta-analysis included studies with a narrower focus on interventions related to the reporting of suicide and suicidal behaviour. Finally, the only outcome considered in this meta-analysis was suicide. Although this outcome is of highest relevance to suicide prevention, media reports can impact on other domains as well, including help seeking behaviour and stigmatisation that have not been looked at in this meta-analysis.<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>\n",

Our results support the continued use and promotion of guidelines on responsible media reporting of suicide, which are the best available interventions to address and prevent imitation effects in the population.<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> Collaboration between suicide prevention experts and media professionals in implementing these guidelines is an essential part of any suicide prevention strategy. Caution should be exercised in reporting suicides by celebrities in particular. The media will continue to report on newsworthy suicides but have a social responsibility to mitigate the likelihood of the Werther effect.</p>\n",

The laboratory team comprises more than 60 whole time equivalent laboratory and support staff and 5.8 whole time equivalent microbiology consultants and trainees. For the financial year 2018/19 the service received more than 530â000 specimens.

      "        <p>During the study period a member of the duty clinical team for that day carried out the intervention within the offices of the microbiology department between 8 am and 9 am. The intervention was witnessed by the other team member, if applicable, or he or she was informed by telephone if working in a different location. The interventions were either saying âToday will be a quiet dayâ (intervention group) or refraining from saying the word âquietâ in any context (control group). The tone, enthusiasm, and audibility with which the intervention was uttered was at the discretion of the duty member. To minimise confounding we did not disseminate the intervention to colleagues who worked in other departments, such as infection control or biomedical scientists. Each day over a period of 61 days was randomly allocated to the intervention or control using a list prepared before the study start by the trial statistician (PPJP) using the big stick procedure <xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> to minimise imbalance between trial arms. Randomisation was not stratified and was implemented using sequentially numbered opaque envelopes containing that dayâs allocation.

These markers represent clinically relevant objective measurements of workload within the department. Secondary outcomes include the individual components of the composite primary outcome, with telephone calls being further divided into two periods: 9 am to 5 pm and 5 pm to 9 am on week days.

      "        <p>The margin of non-inferiority of 30 clinical episodes was prespecified before completion of the protocol and study start based on the authorsâ experience of what would be considered a clinically significant increase in workload. Based on the data from January, 30 clinical episodes would proportionally represent an additional three clinically related telephone calls, two clinically significant results, and 10 validated results for each duty team member during a 24 hour period. In the absence of a precedent and in discussion with colleagues we believed this to be a sufficient to feel noticeably busier and to justify avoidance of the word quiet. Using a one sided 2.5% level of significance and assuming no difference in the mean primary outcome measure between arms, we calculated that a total sample size of 60 days would be required to show non-inferiority with 80% power.</p>\n",
      "        <p>As sample size calculations were based on data taken in winter and the study took place at a traditionally quieter period (May and June) we planned to undertake a blinded sample size re-estimation at the halfway point. This involved calculation of the aggregate standard deviation (pooled across arms). The sample size re-estimation was undertaken in line with the study protocol. The calculated standard deviation was slightly less than anticipated, indicating slightly higher power than expected. We therefore completed the trial without the sample size amended. As the analysis was blinded to treatment allocation (pooled across arms), there was no impact on overall type I error or bias in treatment effect estimates.</p>\n",

If the upper bound of this 95% confidence interval was less than the margin of non-inferiority of 30, then we considered non-inferiority to be shown. We also calculated the mean difference and 95% confidence intervals for each component of the composite outcome. These analyses were repeated after adjustment for day of week and bed occupancy as potentially important predictors of workload. Total and components of workload were analysed in the subgroups of weekdays and of weekends to determine whether the treatment effect differs between the two subgroups.

The mean number of clinical episodes was 139.0 on control days (n=32) compared with 144.9 on intervention days (n=29), a difference of 5.9 clinical episodes (95% confidence interval â12.9 to 24.7) (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f3\">fig 3</xref>). The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval was less than the prespecified margin of 30 for non-inferiority, thereby providing evidence for non-inferiority. Although the workload was greater on week days than at weekends (a mean increase of 34.6 episodes), the differences between interventions were consistent in the subgroups of week days or weekends with no evidence for an interaction between treatment and type of day (P=0.870). The mean difference between arms was slightly smaller after adjustment for type of day (weekend or week day) and daily bed occupancy (0.4, â15.1 to 15.9); although the upper bound of the confidence interval was still less than 30, supporting non-inferiority. The greatest contribution to workload was validation of results, with a mean 97.0 on control days and 96.2 on intervention days (see supplementary file). No evidence of a difference in workload was found between the intervention and control groups for any of the four components, whether in unadjusted or adjusted analyses or when subgroups analysed by week days or weekends (see supplementary file).</p>\n",

      "        <p>A previous study conducted within an orthopaedic department in a UK hospital found that saying the word quiet impacted on on-call workload and suggested that a Q word specialist manager should be appointed as well as nationwide public initiatives considered to reduce use of the word.<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref> That study, conducted in a different setting to ours, only included referrals during night shifts; did not include a description of sample size justification, suggesting the convenience sample might have introduced bias in the results; and was not reported following CONSORT guidelines, making it difficult to judge whether other important sources of bias existed. In contrast, in our study we followed a prespecified protocol following SPIRIT guidelines, reported results in line with CONSORT guidelines, conducted the study over 61 days, and looked at several different components of workload. As whole days were randomised in our study we also included both day time and out of hours on-call work. A second similar study was performed in an emergency department in Japan.<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref> The authors also found no detrimental effect on workload of using the word quiet. Some of the primary and secondary outcome measures were, however, subjective, although attempts were made to control for subjectivity. Our findings add further weight to these conclusions given the robust statistical power of the study, combined with the measurement of objective data.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Limitations of this study</title>\n",
      "        <p>Our study has several limitations. Firstly, we could not control for the use of the word quiet within the other hospital departments by either staff, patients, or visitors. Secondly, we did not incorporate microbiology ward rounds in our data collection as these are non-standardised and difficult to measure but they could have impacted on the number of clinical inquiries on any given day. Thirdly, we did not control for other confounding factors such as seasonal variation, number of microbiological samples received, or presence of black cats, cracked mirrors, or lone magpies. Fourthly, while our margin of non-inferiority was prespecified before the study began and was based on the clinical judgment of the authors and colleagues, it was not derived from a formal consensus building approach, as is sometimes recommended. Fifthly, a chance imbalance in treatment allocation occurred between weekdays and weekends (see <xref rid=\"tbl1\" ref-type=\"table\">table 1</xref>). Randomisation was not stratified and therefore chance imbalances are possible. We have presented adjusted analyses that showed slightly smaller differences between arms, and subgroup analyses with no evidence of interactions. Our study was not powered to detect treatment-covariate interactions, but we nevertheless consider that the totality of the evidence overwhelmingly supports our conclusion of non-inferiority. Day of week and bed occupancy are likely predictors of workload and we would recommend restricted randomisation to balance one or both factors for future randomised clinical trials in this area. Finally, this trial was conducted in a single study centre over a two month period, which might limit generalisability to other populations.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Implications of this study</title>\n",
      "        <p>As found by this study, medical microbiologists have a huge number of clinical encounters each day from discussions of clinical cases to the validation of reports and communication of clinically significant results. Appreciably among this number the case mix can vary hugely across all specialties and age groupsâeach call for advice presents a unique challenge. However, the components of the primary outcome forms only a part of the role of medical microbiologists. The challenges within infection management are ever increasing, with healthcare associated infections; emerging and re-emerging infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, monkey pox, and measles; and, arguably most concerning, increasing antimicrobial resistance.<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> Point prevalence data from 2011-12 highlighted that about 30% of patients in UK hospitals received an antimicrobial agent,<xref rid=\"ref12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref> indicating the scale of the role of medical microbiologists. Antibiotic stewardship,<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref> guideline development, and infection control also form key parts of the medical microbiology discipline. Microbiology is a small specialty with 682 consultant medical microbiologists in the UK and 233 medical microbiology or combined microbiology and infectious diseases trainees. Overall, 35 clinical scientists hold a fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists (FRCPath) and practice medical microbiology.<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>Clearly this study is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but it highlights an important problem. The 2018 report from the joint Health Foundation and Kings Fund on the healthcare workforce in England highlighted that âThere are significant staff shortages across the NHS. There are over 100,000 vacancies across NHS trusts (1 in 11 posts). In addition, the staff that are in post are under increasing stress: the latest NHS staff survey showed that 38% of staff had felt unwell during the previous 12 months due to work-related stress.â<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> A Royal College of Physicians report in 2016 notes that the NHS is underfunded, under-doctored, and overstretched, resulting in falling morale, productivity, and patient experience.<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> In the face of such immovable obstacles is it any wonder that staff hope that luck falls on their side?</p>\n",
      "        <p>Our study confirms what is probably already knownâthat superstitions such as not uttering the quiet word will not ease the heavy workload faced by healthcare professionals. As our study shows, in one shift a single microbiologist can expect to encounter 140 clinical episodes; this number exceeded 190 on eight days during the two month study period. Healthcare professionals need to be resilient and mindful to care for their own wellbeing as well as those around them.</p>\n",

      "      <p>Primary infection with varicella zoster virus causes varicella (known commonly as chickenpox), typically in children. Herpes zoster (or shingles) arises from reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus following reduced cell mediated immunity, some years after the primary infection. Uncomplicated zoster is typically a mild, self limiting condition, but complications can occur,<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref> some of which, such as encephalitis, lead to severe illness, high healthcare costs, and mortality,<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref> whereas others, such as post-herpetic neuralgia and Ramsay Hunt syndrome, can seriously affect quality of life.<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref> In 1965, Hope-Simpson proposed that immunity to the varicella zoster virus is boosted through exposure to varicella contacts,<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref> later called the exogenous boosting hypothesis, as well as asymptomatic reactivation of varicella zoster virus, called endogenous boosting. Although a varicella vaccine is available, in many countries, including 17 European countries (including the United Kingdom), New Zealand, and China, it is not part of routine childhood vaccination programmes.<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref> This is partly because of concerns that its introduction would lead to a temporary increase in the number of cases of herpes zoster for 30-50 years, following removal of circulating varicella zoster virus.<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "      <p>Although not universally accepted, epidemiological risk factor studies assessing the risk of zoster after exposure to varicella, and immunological studies assessing varicella zoster virus specific immunity after exposure to varicella, provide some credence to the exogenous boosting hypothesis.<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref> What is less well understood is the degree and duration of any protection conferred from re-exposure to varicella on future risk of zoster. Some cost effectiveness analyses informing varicella vaccination policy assume that exogenous boosting provides complete protection from zoster for up to 20 years, after which individuals revert to full susceptibility (the temporary immunity hypothesis).<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> Others, however, incorporate different assumptions<xref rid=\"ref12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>âfor example, that exposure to varicella confers partial protection that wanes but can accumulate on repeated exposure (the progressive immunity hypothesis).<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref> Lack of understanding about the role of exogenous boosting has meant public health decision making relies on mathematical models based on varied, and largely unsubstantiated, assumptions.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>\n",

      "      <p>Model based projections predict a higher incidence of zoster after varicella vaccination, resulting from a reduction in exogenous boosting, with zoster incidences peaking around 30 years after implementation in individual based models<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> and 20 years in older deterministic models. Real-world evidence to date, however, does not entirely support these predictions. In the United Statesâthe only country with a universal two dose varicella vaccination programme (introduced in 2007) of sufficient length for potential changes in zoster incidence to be observedâevidence suggests zoster began increasing before the introduction of the programme and continued to increase at similar rates after implementation.<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref> In Australia, where a state funded one dose varicella vaccination programme has been in place since 2006, no increases in hospital admissions for zoster have been observed.<xref rid=\"ref18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref> This might be explained by low varicella vaccine coverage or initial insufficient one dose vaccine schedules, or both, allowing ongoing transmission of the varicella zoster virus with some exogenous boosting. Changes in zoster incidence might also be explained by demographic changes, such as declining birth rates<xref rid=\"ref19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref> and the introduction of a vaccine against zoster. The lack of the predicted increase in zoster after routine varicella vaccination questions whether varicella zoster virus boosting from exposure to varicella contacts is as important as thought at a population level.<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\n",

      "        <p>The self controlled case series method relies on three key assumptions. Firstly, recurrent events (or outcomes) must be independentâthat is, the chance of a second event is not influenced by having a first event. Zoster can recur (although recurrence is rare in people who are immunocompetent),<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref> and therefore this assumption could be violated; however, when the event is rare (which applies to zoster), considering only the first zoster episode is a valid approach to overcoming this potential bias.<xref rid=\"ref24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref> Secondly, the occurrence of an event (zoster) should not alter the probability of subsequent exposure (to varicella). People with zoster are infectious during the blister phase and this might result in varicella if they are in direct contact with susceptible contacts. As zoster could lead to an increased incidence of varicella this might artificially inflate the relative rate of zoster events occurring in unexposed versus exposed (to varicella) periods. This can be overcome by removing a predefined period before (varicella) exposure from all other unexposed (baseline) time.<xref rid=\"ref34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref> Thirdly, the event of interest must not censor the observation periodâfor example, if the zoster event increases the likelihood of death. This assumption is fulfilled, as zoster is rarely associated with increased mortality.<xref rid=\"ref35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref> Supplementary box e-1 provides a detailed discussion of these fundamental assumptions.</p>\n",

We then used the family practice number to match these cases of varicella with cases of zoster. Exposure to varicella had to occur during the observation period of adults with zoster. If varicella was recorded in both hospital episode statistics and CPRD within the same contact, we used the earliest recorded diagnosis. For varicella cases identified in hospital episode statistics, we defined the date of varicella diagnosis as the date patients were admitted.

Rotavirus would not plausibly be expected to influence the future risk of zoster. Therefore, we did not expect to see a temporal association between exposure to gastroenteritis and zoster incidence; any association would call into question exogenous boosting as the interpretation of a positive result in the main analysis. We selected only gastroenteritis events up to 2012 (as rotavirus vaccination was introduced in 2013) and only the first episode of gastroenteritis. Acute gastroenteritis was defined using a comprehensive list of Read and hospital episode statistics codes, to identify primary care related (general practitioner diagnosed) and secondary care related (hospital diagnosed) events, respectively, until December 2012.

The median age at first zoster diagnosis was 41.1 years (interquartile range 33.1-51.3 years) and at first known exposure to varicella was 38.3 (32.3-48.8) years (<xref rid=\"tbl1\" ref-type=\"table\">table 1</xref>). The median age of the children at varicella episode was 3.8 (2.3-5.7) years. The median observation period was 14.7 (11.1-17.7) years. In total, 118 (1.2%) participants were severely immunosuppressed at the time of exposure to varicella. Participantsâ ages varied widely at the start of the observation period (supplementary fig e-2) and at exposure to varicella and diagnosis of zoster (supplementary fig e-3).</p>\n",

After adjustment for the confounding effects of age, exposure to a household contact with varicella was associated with a reduced risk of zoster among adults for up to 20 years (<xref rid=\"tbl2\" ref-type=\"table\">table 2</xref>); adults were 33% less likely to develop zoster within two years of exposure to varicella (incidence ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.73) than during baseline (unexposed) time. The incidence ratio moved closer to 1 with time since varicella exposure; after exclusion of the baseline and pre-exposure groups, some evidence suggested a linear trend (P=0.03, comparison between a model with no exposure group and one with linear exposure). Ten to 20 years after exposure to a varicella contact, adults were 27% less likely to develop zoster (incidence ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.87) than during baseline (unexposed) time.</p>\n",

When the risk period was defined as indefinite after exposure to varicella (that is, all observation time after exposure to varicella, not limited to 20 years after exposure to varicella), no evidence of an association was found between exposure to varicella and risk of zoster 20 years after exposure (incidence ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 2.74; see supplementary table e-3); however, the confidence intervals were wide, as only seven zoster events occurred.</p>\n",

      "      <p>This self controlled case series study found a reduced risk of zoster associated with exposure to a household contact with varicella, with modest but long lasting protective effects observed. Strong evidence suggests that in adults the risk of zoster within two years of exposure to a child with varicella in the household was 33% lower than in the baseline period, and in the 10-20 years post-exposure the risk was 27% lower. No evidence was found to indicate that protection against reactivation of the varicella zoster virus accumulates on repeated exposure (the progressive immunity hypothesis); however, the study might have been underpowered to detect an effect. These data challenge the assumption previously used in public health policy modelling in certain countries, including the UK, that through exogenous boosting people exposed to varicella are completely immune to zoster for between two and 20 years.<xref rid=\"ref39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>\n",

      "        <p>In this study we used a self controlled case series design to test the duration of varicella zoster virus exogenous boosting, which enabled us to control for confounding between participants and capture the precise timing of the included varicella and zoster diagnoses. Although our research question potentially violates some of the assumptions of self controlled case series methodology, we used recommended approaches to tackle these issues, including studying only first events and including a pre-exposure period in the analyses (supplementary box e-1). We controlled for the confounding effects of age, as evidenced by our negative outcome analysis (exploring the link between varicella contact and hip fracture); after exposure to varicella the relative rate of hip fractures was observed to increase substantially over time, but after adjustment for age as a spline based effect, the associations were no longer evident.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Capture of zoster cases is likely to be reliable and comprehensive. Zoster is typically a straightforward diagnosis, as it has a characteristic dermatomal distribution. Evidence suggests that most people with zoster seek out healthcare: a US based health and retirement survey among adults aged 55 and older reported that more than 91% who self reported herpes zoster had sought medical care<xref rid=\"ref40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>; another US based survey about immunisation practices in the US among adults aged 60 and older found that 95% of those who knew they had zoster sought care<xref rid=\"ref41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>; and a community based retrospective survey in Beijing, China (all ages) found that 92.4% of participants had sought healthcare for zoster.<xref rid=\"ref42\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref> Varicella is similarly a straightforward diagnosis, so our records are likely to be reliable. We used a population based sample, representative of the UK population for age, sex, and ethnicity<xref rid=\"ref20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref> and therefore our findings are likely to be generalisable to the UK population.</p>\n",
      "        <p>This study also has some limitations. Varicella is likely to be under-ascertained in UK electronic health records; varicella tends to be a mild, self limiting condition that does not require a visit to the doctor, and consultations with doctors for varicella have been declining in the UK (between 2004 and 2014 by around 20% in 1-3 year olds and 6% in 4-6 year olds).<xref rid=\"ref43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref> This misclassification of varicella exposure might result in some true exposed time being misclassified as unexposed time (if the household contacts with varicella did not attend their general practice or our observation period did not cover the time of first exposure) and could therefore bias the effect estimate towards the null, thus potentially underestimating the effect of exogenous boosting. We were not able to capture occupational exposure to varicella, such as in healthcare or childcare workers: about two million people, or 5% of the population of England, during their work could be exposed to children with varicella.<xref rid=\"ref44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref> Household cases of varicella are, however, likely to cluster together; studies suggest that about 78% of healthy household contacts develop varicella.<xref rid=\"ref46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref> In this case, if only a second or subsequent child presented to the doctor, the true first exposure would likely be in the 60 day pre-exposure period (because household clusters tend to occur within a few weeks of each other). This would mean that our current estimate for 0-&lt;2 years is biased away from the nullâthat is, we have overestimated boosting effects in the 0-&lt;2 yearsâ risk period.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Owing to the under-ascertainment of varicella in medical records, it is possible that those represented in general practice records might have more severe varicella. If this was the case, we would expect the cases to have a relatively higher viral load than the average individual with varicella, and potentially this would result in a greater degree of boosting in exposed adults. Therefore, by capturing more severe varicella cases, our study might have overestimated the degree of exogenous boosting.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We did not validate the family number variable (which identifies all those living in the same household), so we might have wrongly identified those as living in the same household. People can move in or out of households and people living together could be registered at different practices. This misclassification of varicella exposure is likely to be non-differential for zoster and thus would bias the effect estimates towards the null. However, we ensured that exposure to varicella occurred during the observation period of the participant with zoster to reduce the misclassification of varicella. We also removed diagnoses of varicella recorded in the six months following a personâs registration at their general practice, to ensure varicella diagnoses were incident and that we were not capturing historical varicella recorded as part of practice registration.</p>\n",
      "        <p>CPRD registered patients leaving one CPRD practice and entering another are not currently identifiable in the database. In theory therefore it is possible for patients to be entered twice in CPRD and thus appearing as two different people. However, patientsâ medical records are transferred to their new practice. Therefore, any such patient would have a record, and therefore a history, of zoster before CPRD follow-up and be excluded from our study population during the time they were in their second practice. Furthermore, the rate of recurrent zoster is low (estimated to be between 1% and 6%)<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>; therefore if patients have a diagnosis of zoster recorded within one medical practice and transfer to another in CPRD, they are unlikely to have been included in our study again as their risk of varicella zoster virus being reactivated again is low.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We found no evidence of effect modification by immunosuppression status. It could be hypothesised that patients with severe immunosuppression might not experience the same degree of exogenous boosting, compared with immunocompetent patients, when exposed to a child with varicella; if their immune system is weakened, they may be unable to mount an effective immune response. Unfortunately, our study was underpowered to detect a difference in the boosting effect among immunosuppressed people, as only 1.2% of our study sample were immunosuppressed at exposure to varicella.</p>\n",
      "        <p>The study design required patients with zoster to be living with a child with varicella, therefore the study cohort is younger than a general population with zoster. If younger adults are more likely to attend their general practice only when zoster is severe, this could affect the generalisability of our study by making it more applicable to how exposure to varicella in the household protects against severe cases of zoster. However, when we restricted our analysis to adults aged 50 and older at exposure to varicella, a similar pattern of association was observed, with no evidence of effect modification by age (<xref rid=\"tbl3\" ref-type=\"table\">table 3</xref>). This suggests that although the median age of our study cohort (at exposure to varicella) was low, the findings can be generalised to older people.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Finally, bias could be introduced if inclusion in our study (that is, visits to a general practitioner for zoster) is differential according to the timing of exposure to a household contact with varicella. All our comparisons were within person, therefore health seeking biases are less likely. However, an individualâs health seeking behaviour might vary over time. It is plausible that parents caring for children with varicella might be less likely to attend a general practice during the acute phase of zoster owing to child care responsibilities. This would result in slightly lower ascertainment of zoster in the week after a diagnosis of varicella, which could have pulled the association between exposure to varicella and risk of zoster towards the null for the first risk period (0-&lt;2 years post-exposure).</p>\n",

      "        <p>In a systematic review of epidemiological studies investigating the reduction in risk of zoster from exposure to varicella, 27 of 40 studies showed evidence of varicella zoster virus exogenous boosting, although the duration and magnitude of boosting could not be determined.<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref> The review identified nine epidemiological risk factor studies that investigated the risk of zoster after exposure to children generally and to children with varicella, four of which found evidence of varicella zoster virus exogenous boosting .<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref> Studies found that the degree of protection from exposure to children ranged from a 25%<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> to 70%<xref rid=\"ref47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref> reduced risk, with studies using different time frames and numbers of exposures to varicella. In our study we used medical record data on the timing of exposure to both zoster and varicella, and thus might offer more reliable estimates of effect than studies relying on patient recall<xref rid=\"ref47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref> or using living with children as a proxy for exposure to varicella contacts.<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> The review also included four prospective immunological studies analysing immunity to varicella zoster virus after exposure to varicella, measured using antibody titres; however, only two studies had data for up to one year after exposure. One longitudinal study showed that among grandparents re-exposed to varicella, the associated increased immune response to varicella zoster virus (measured as varicella zoster virus specific T cell immunity and antibody titres) was not universal and was noticeable for less than one year.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> Our results, indicating that exposure to a varicella contact might protect against zoster for over two years, may reflect the difficulty in measuring the immune response to varicella zoster virus.</p>\n",
      "        <p>To date no clear-cut increase in zoster incidence attributed to routinely vaccinating against varicella has been observed, as predicted by modelling studies incorporating the exogenous boosting hypothesis.<xref rid=\"ref17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref> The US has had a two dose varicella vaccination programme since 2007 and therefore could serve as a comparison to modelling predictions; here zoster incidence began increasing before the introduction of the vaccine.<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> However, estimates of the timing of the first measurable increase in zoster vary according to the type of model and its assumptions, thus although the US has only seen a similar increase in zoster incidence as before varicella vaccination, it is possible that the ârealâ effect might only occur after more than 20 years from the vaccination programme being introduced. If, however, boosting does not provide complete immunity, as suggested by this self controlled case series, then the population impact of varicella vaccination on zoster incidence might not be as great as some model based studies predicted.<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of varicella vaccination and risk of zoster concluded that although exogenous boosting is plausible at an individual level, no conclusive evidence exists to date that varicella vaccination has a substantial population level impact on zoster.<xref rid=\"ref17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>A priori, we hypothesised that as women are more likely to be the primary caregiver and thus have more direct physical contact with children with varicella, the degree of protection gained from boosting would be greater among women. We found the opposite. This could suggest that men mount a more effective immune response when boosted by exposure to a varicella case; most childhood infections are more severe in boys than in girls,<xref rid=\"ref48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref> therefore this could lead to greater immune memory and greater potential for boosting. It is also well established that zoster occurs more often in women,<xref rid=\"ref49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref> supporting the hypothesis of lower residual immunity in women. Alternatively, women may have more exposures to children outside the household, so the household boosting effect in men is therefore more pronounced.</p>\n",

      "        <p>Future studies should substantiate these findings using different data sources; particular design improvements could be larger samples, to capture more individuals with repeated exposures to varicella (and thus better understand whether exogenous boosting with varicella zoster virus provides a fixed level of immunity or progressive immunity against zoster) and existing immunosuppression, older age samples with more adults aged 50 years and older where the burden of zoster exists, as well as data with better capture of exposure to varicella outside the household, particularly among grandparents.</p>\n",

These findings are themselves unable to justify for or against specific vaccination schedules, but they do suggest that revised mathematical models are required to estimate the impact of varicella vaccination, with the updated assumption that exogenous boosting is incomplete and only reduces the risk of zoster by about 30%.</p>\n",

      "          <p>Cohort sizes ranged from 1.3 to 4.1 million, depending on the outcome. The number of women exposed to duloxetine varied by cohort and exposure contrast and was around 2500-3000 for early pregnancy exposure and 900-950 for late pregnancy exposure. The base risk per 1000 unexposed women was 36.6 (95% confidence interval 36.3 to 36.9) for congenital malformations overall, 13.7 (13.5 to 13.9) for cardiovascular malformations, 107.8 (107.3 to 108.3) for preterm birth, 20.4 (20.1 to 20.6) for small for gestational age infant, 33.6 (33.3 to 33.9) for pre-eclampsia, and 23.3 (23.1 to 23.4) for postpartum hemorrhage. After adjustment for measured potential confounding variables, all baseline characteristics were well balanced for all exposure contrasts. In propensity score adjusted analyses versus unexposed pregnancies, the relative risk was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.33) for congenital malformations overall and 1.29 (0.99 to 1.68) for cardiovascular malformations. For preterm birth, the relative risk was 1.01 (0.92 to 1.10) for early exposure and 1.19 (1.04 to 1.37) for late exposure. For small for gestational age infants the relative risks were 1.14 (0.92 to 1.41) and 1.20 (0.83 to 1.72) for early and late pregnancy exposure, respectively, and for pre-eclampsia they were 1.12 (0.96 to 1.31) and 1.04 (0.80 to 1.35). The relative risk for postpartum hemorrhage was 1.53 (1.08 to 2.18). Results from sensitivity analyses were generally consistent with the findings from the main analyses.</p>\n",

      "          <p>On the basis of the evidence available to date, duloxetine is unlikely to be a major teratogen but may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and a small increased risk of cardiac malformations. While continuing to monitor the safety of duloxetine as data accumulate over time, these potential small increases in risk of relatively uncommon outcomes must be weighed against the benefits of treating depression and pain during pregnancy in a given patient.</p>\n",

      "      <p>Duloxetine is a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which was first approved in the United States in August 2004. In addition to depression, it is indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, generalized anxiety disorder, fibromyalgia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain in the US. These conditions often affect women of childbearing age, and drug treatment of these conditions in pregnancy is common given the risks associated with untreated depression, anxiety, and pain.<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref> The US Food and Drug Administration therefore requested Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of duloxetine, to set up an pregnancy exposure registry following its approval for the management of fibromyalgia in June 2008.<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref> However, as is the case for many such registries,<xref rid=\"ref3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref> despite aggressive outreach efforts, enrollment has not reached its goal. By August 2019 the Cymbalta Pregnancy Registry had enrolled only 127 women of the target 484.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Limited information from other post-marketing surveillance systems generally suggests a similar pattern of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women using duloxetine during pregnancy compared with the general population.<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref> One multicenter study based on data from national teratogen information services including 168 live births prenatally exposed to duloxetine reported three (1.8%) major malformations, which was considered to be within the expected baseline range in that population.<xref rid=\"ref4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref> Another study based on the Swedish Birth Registry identified 286 liveborn infants exposed to duloxetine in the first trimester, seven of whom were born with malformations (relative risk of 0.8).<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref> A recent review of the literature concluded that the evidence for duloxetine is limited (668 exposed pregnancies) but does not suggest a clinically important increased risk of major congenital malformations, although specific malformation types could not be evaluated.<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref> An analysis of Danish registry data suggested that duloxetine use might be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "      <p>Given the limitations of spontaneous adverse event reports (for example, under-reporting, no information on the total number of women exposed), the modest size of existing cohort studies, and the small sample size and challenges faced with enrolment in the Cymbalta Pregnancy Registry, additional information is needed to support conclusions about the safety of duloxetine with respect to congenital malformations, as well as other adverse outcomes of pregnancy. This study was conducted to supplement the Cymbalta Pregnancy Registry with other sources of real world evidence on the safety of duloxetine during pregnancy to help to meet the post-marketing requirements as specified in the new drug approval. It evaluates the risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes following in utero exposure to duloxetine in a large cohort of pregnant women.</p>\n",

      "        <p>We conducted a cohort study nested in the nationwide Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) from 2004 to 2013. At the time the study was conducted, the latest available year of MAX data was 2013. The MAX dataset contains individual level demographic and insurance enrollment information, as well as data on all medical visits and hospital admissions, diagnoses, and procedures received as an inpatient or an outpatient and all filled outpatient drug prescriptions for Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid covers the medical expenses for approximately 50% of all pregnancies in the US. We linked completed pregnancies in women aged 18 to 55 years to liveborn infants by using a linkage algorithm based on state of residence, Medicaid case number, and date of delivery. Details of the cohort development and procedures implemented to ensure accurate linkage and complete capture of information have previously been described in detail.<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\n",

      "        <p>Because the etiologically relevant exposure window, the outcome assessment window, and the covariate assessment window differ depending on the outcome of interest, we created four different cohorts by using different Medicaid eligibility requirements for the mother and the offspring (<xref rid=\"tbl1\" ref-type=\"table\">table 1</xref>). We required continuous eligibility for Medicaid (without gaps) from the start of the covariate assessment window through the end of the outcome assessment window. In addition, the cohort used to study the risk of congenital malformations excluded pregnancies with a chromosomal abnormality (n=2667) and pregnancies with exposure to a known teratogenic drug (warfarin, antineoplastic agents, lithium, isotretinoin, misoprostol, thalidomide) during the first trimester (n=2779).</p>\n",

      "        <p>We considered women who filled at least one outpatient prescription for duloxetine during the etiologically relevant window to be exposed to duloxetine. For congenital malformations, the etiologically relevant window is the first trimester of pregnancy, coinciding with the period of organogenesis. For postpartum hemorrhage, the hypothesized mechanism by which duloxetine and similar drugs might increase the risk is by depleting platelet serotonin.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref> Consequently, we defined the etiologically relevant window as the month before the babyâs delivery date. For the outcomes of preterm delivery, small for gestational age infant, and pre-eclampsia, two pregnancy exposure periods are potentially etiologically relevant. These outcomes have been associated with abnormalities in placental development, as well as maternal and fetal factors that develop in late pregnancy. We therefore considered exposure during the first 20 weeks of gestation (that is, last menstrual period (LMP) to day 140 of pregnancy), as well as late pregnancy exposure (day 141 of pregnancy to day 245âthe time point at which the outcomes can begin to occur) (<xref rid=\"tbl1\" ref-type=\"table\">table 1</xref>).</p>\n",

Because of the use of an external reference group, little to no adjustment for confounding was made in this pooled estimate.<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>\n",

      "        <title>Strengths and limitations of study</title>\n",
      "        <p>This study has several strengths including the use of a large population based cohort representative of publicly insured pregnant women in the US, prospectively collected exposure information eliminating the potential for recall bias, availability of internal reference groups, ability to study a broad range of maternal and infant outcomes, and rich information for adjustment for confounding.</p>\n",
      "        <p>However, as is the case for any epidemiologic study based on healthcare utilization data, the study also has some limitations. Firstly, we had to estimate the date of the last menstrual period by using diagnostic information on preterm birth, which may have resulted in some misclassification of the exposure window for the congenital malformations cohort and some misalignment of the early versus late exposure windows for the preterm, small for gestational age, and pre-eclampsia cohorts. However, validation studies suggest that algorithm derived prenatal exposure to antidepressants has a sensitivity and a positive predictive value of at least 95% and a specificity and a negative predictive value of almost 100%.<xref rid=\"ref26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>Secondly, not all women filling a prescription will necessarily take the drug as prescribed, which results in some misclassification of the exposure status. We countered this through the use of sensitivity analyses in which we required women to have filled at least two prescriptions during the etiologically relevant window (increasing the specificity of the exposure definition) or to have a dayâs supply that overlaps with the etiologically relevant window (increasing the sensitivity of the exposure definition). Although not perfect, short of pill counts or blood level measurementsâneither of which is feasible in the context of the large scale studies needed to study drug safety in pregnancyâthey are the best available measures of exposure status.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Thirdly, we ascertained outcomes on the basis of diagnostic and procedure codes recorded for reimbursement purposes, leading to potential misclassification of the outcome. To overcome this concern, we did an internal outcome validation study for those outcomes that had not previously been validated (that is, major congenital malformations other than cardiac, postpartum hemorrhage, preterm delivery, and small for gestational age infant). We linked pregnancies in MAX with the outcome of interest defined on the basis of diagnostic or procedure claims to medical records for patients who were treated at hospitals that are part of Partners Healthcare (which includes Brigham and Womenâs Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital). We retrieved 50 medical records from pregnancies defined with these codes for each outcome, and two physicians who were blinded to the drug exposure status reviewed the charts according to established clinical criteria and classified the outcome as present or absent. We used the resulting positive predictive values to inform probabilistic bias analyses that generated corrected relative risk estimates.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref> As a second approach to assess the robustness of our findings to outcome misclassification, we matched exposed to non-exposed women (from the primary analysis for each outcome, using the propensity score) in a 1:1 ratio for outcomes with a prevalence of at least 3% in the unexposed cohort and in a 1:5 ratio for outcomes with a prevalence of less than 3% by using a nearest neighbor algorithm. We generated de-identified claims profiles of mothers or infants with the outcome of interest as defined using the outcome algorithms for all cases in the matched cohort. Expert clinicians reviewed the profiles, blinded to the exposure status, and âadjudicatedâ each case as the outcome likely occurred, the outcome probably occurred, or the outcome likely did not occur. As we strived for high specificity of the outcome definition to ensure the that relative risk is unbiased, we assessed the effect of excluding either or both of the last two types of case on the relative risk estimates. Two clinicians reviewed each profile. Disagreements in the initial determination were resolved through discussion. Findings from both approaches to reduce outcome misclassification were generally consistent with those from the main analyses, taking the imprecision of some of the estimates into account.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Fourthly, despite the rich information available for adjustment for confounders, potential always exists for residual confounding in observational studies. We implemented several different approaches to minimize this possibility, including the use of alternative comparator groups (women exposed to other antidepressants, women exposed to duloxetine before but not during pregnancy) and the use of high dimensional propensity scores to adjust for proxies of unmeasured confounders.<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> Additionally, we explored the effect of potential residual confounding by lifestyle factors poorly measured in claims data (that is, alcohol, smoking, and obesity) but available in external data such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) by using binary algebraic solutions (see appendix (sFigures 20-24) for details).<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>Fifthly, we used a cohort of pregnancies resulting in live birth, because no validated algorithms are available to estimate the gestational age in non-live births. Consequently, the risk of spontaneous abortion, termination, and stillbirth could not be studied using this cohort. Findings from a preliminary exploratory assessment of the association between duloxetine and pregnancy losses are reported elsewhere (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.encepp.eu\">www.encepp.eu</ext-link>). In addition, the restriction to live births may introduce selection bias if differences exist in the proportion of terminations between women treated with duloxetine and untreated women within levels of covariates used in the adjustment. We explored the potential effect of such selection bias by using methods proposed by Greenland and Khoury,<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>\n",

Conclusions about potential associations between duloxetine use and the various outcomes considered were informed by the main analyses as well as the broad range of sensitivity analyses conducted to test the robustness of the findings in light of potential threats to the study validity (misclassification, confounding, selection bias, and random error).</p>\n",

      "        <p>Pregnancy exposure registries and epidemiologic studies that rely on real world evidence from healthcare utilization data to evaluate safety of drugs during pregnancy are complementary approaches, each having distinct strengths and weaknesses. Using a pregnancy cohort nested in the nationwide MAX data, we were able to add to the initial evidence on the risk of congenital malformations with duloxetine and to generate the first evidence on other maternal and fetal outcomes. We conclude that duloxetine is likely not a major teratogen but may be associated with small increases in the risk of cardiac malformations, postpartum hemorrhage, and possibly small for gestational age infants. Important directions for future research include the replication of these analyses using a different dataset but similar rigorous approaches to overcome the residual uncertainty from both random and potential systematic errors, continued surveillance as more data accumulate over time to increase precision and therefore our confidence in the findings, and the study of non-livebirth outcomes by using datasets with reliable information on the start of pregnancies ending in non-live births. Because MAX does not include information on lactation, questions about the safety of duloxetine use during lactation remain unanswered. Until such additional information becomes available, the potential small increases in risk of relatively uncommon outcomes that we observed must be weighed against the benefits of treating depression and pain during pregnancy for both the motherâs and the infantâs health, a trade-off that is likely to be different for each individual patient.</p>\n",

Before the act, individuals had to belong to a specific category (eg, children, pregnant women, people with disabilities) in order to be eligible for Medicaid coverage. The Affordable Care Act effectively eliminated these categories for eligibility and replaced them with uniform eligibility criteriaânamely, below 138% of the federal poverty level ($17â236 (Â£13â193; â¬15â480) for a household of one in 2019) for states that expanded Medicaid programs.

We found statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics, including race/ethnicity, education attainment, employment status, and health insurance coverage, between the expansion and non-expansion states. We also found that the average out-of-pocket spending, premium contributions, and out-of-pocket plus premium spending at baseline were significantly lower in the expansion states than in the non-expansion states. Similarly, the probability of individuals experiencing a catastrophic financial burden among our study population at baseline was significantly lower in the expansion states than in the non-expansion states.</p>\n",

      "        <p>Using a nationally representative sample of the low income non-elderly population in the US, we found that the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions were associated with lower out-of-pocket spending, lower out-of-pocket plus premium spending, and lower probability of experiencing a catastrophic financial burden at the national level in the third and fourth years of the implementation. We found no significant changes in the first two years of its implementation, and no evidence that premium contributions changed after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. These findings should be reassuring for policy makers as they suggest that the act successfully achieved one of its primary goalsânamely, improving national protection from financial risk against medical bills among low income adults.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Our four years of data indicate that not only were Medicaid expansions associated with a statistically significant improvement in financial risk protection, but also the magnitude of the effect was large and clinically meaningful. Given that our analyses included both adults who were affected by the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions and adults who were not (eg, adults who were already covered by Medicaid before the Act, did not take up Medicaid after the Medicaid expansions, and were covered by private insurance throughout the study period), the size of effects among adults who were newly covered by the Medicaid program should be larger than the estimated impact in our study. We found no evidence that premium contributions changed after the introduction of the Medicaid expansions, suggesting that the national reduction in healthcare spending was driven primarily by the previously uninsured population being newly covered by the Medicaid programs (and not by individuals previously covered by the private health insurance switching to Medicaid).</p>\n",
      "        <p>Our findings suggest that it took two years for out-of-pocket spending to decrease after the Medicaid expansions. This delay might reflect a gradual take-up of Medicaid programs in expansion states as it could take several years for beneficiaries, program administrators, and providers to learn and implement Medicaid expansions.<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref> Possibly, also, a reduction in out-of-pocket spending during the first two years might have been offset by a âpent-up demandâ among newly insured individuals, who were foregoing or delaying care due to a lack of insurance before Medicaid expansions.<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\n",

      "        <p>Our sensitivity analysis, restricted to participants with family incomes lower than 100% of the federal poverty level, showed a larger reduction in healthcare spending after the Medicaid expansions than we estimated in our main analysis (analysis of individuals with income below 138% of the federal poverty level). This larger reduction might indicate that the benefit of Medicaid coverage on financial risk protection is larger for lower income families. Possibly, also, the effect size was smaller among individuals with income in the range 100-138% of the federal poverty level because those individuals in this range living in the non-expansion states had access to subsidized health insurance marketplace plans developed by the Affordable Care Act.<xref rid=\"ref44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>\n",

      "        <p>Our estimates indicate that one in seven low income individuals could still have a catastrophic financial burden even in the expansion states after the implementation of Medicaid expansions (appendix table E), and there are several possible reasons for this. First, individuals eligible for Medicaid could have periods without health insurance owing to coverage transitions associated with changes in life circumstances, such as a job and income changes (âchurningâ).<xref rid=\"ref45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref> Second, although states generally charge no premiums and nominal cost sharing (eg, $4 per outpatient service) for Medicaid enrollees,<xref rid=\"ref46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref> the total spending of enrollees could still be financially catastrophic for individuals with very low income. Possibly, also, some states are charging higher premiums and cost sharing from Medicaid beneficiaries through waivers.<xref rid=\"ref47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref> Finally, those with a high deductible private health insurance plan could still have a catastrophic financial burden even with health insurance coverage when they receive expensive healthcare services.<xref rid=\"ref48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref>\n",

      "        <p>Our study builds on previous studies that examined the effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions on household spending on healthcare. Miller and Wherry analyzed a national survey and found that the Medicaid expansions were associated with a significant decrease in respondents reporting âyesâ to questionnaires asking if they were âworried about the ability to pay medical bills in the event of an illness or bad accident and problems paying medical bills.â<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref> Sommers et al studied the impact of Medicaid expansions using the data from three states (Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas) and reported that Medicaid expansions were associated with a reduction in annual out-of-pocket spending of $88.<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> Other reports include studies recording reduced collection balances in expansion states using credit bureau data,<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>\n",

      "        <title>Limitations of the study</title>\n",
      "        <p>Our study has some limitations. First, although we used a difference-in-difference method to account for unmeasured confounders, expansion and non-expansion states could differ in a way that was not captured by a quasi-experimental approach. For example, although the federal government provides finances to cover more than 90% of costs for newly eligible individuals, some states did not expand Medicaid owing to concerns about the long term financial sustainability of their Medicaid programs.<xref rid=\"ref49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref> We could not eliminate the possibility of biases due to an event (eg, budget constraint) occurring at the same time as the Medicaid expansions that affected expansion and non-expansion states differently. However, the parallel trends of outcome variables between expansion and non-expansion states before the Medicaid expansions observed in our data support the validity of our findings. Second, the confidence intervals of some of our estimates were relatively large. Therefore, although we were confident about the statistical significance, we could not make precise estimates of the effect size of the Affordable Care Act Medical expansions. Future studies with larger samples are warranted to make more precise estimations of the effect sizes. Finally, people who responded to the survey might have different characteristics than those who did not. For this to introduce a non-response bias in our estimates, however, systematic differences between respondents and non-respondents must also differ systematically between expansion and non-expansion states, which we think is unlikely.</p>\n",

      "        <p>In summary, using a nationally representative sample of the low income, non-elderly population, we found lower out-of-pocket spending, lower out-of-pocket plus premium spending, and a lower likelihood of catastrophic financial burden in the third and fourth years after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions. Our findings suggest that the Act is probably achieving a key goalâimproved financial risk protection from healthcare spending among low income adults.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Our study has important policy implications. The constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act is once again being challenged in the courts by attorneys from 18 states, and its repeal or substantial modification continues to be discussed by policy makers. Our findings suggest that, if our findings were causal, as many as one million low income individuals could face catastrophic financial burden nationally, if the Medicaid expansions were to be repealed.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Finally, even though our results show significant reductions in out-of-pocket spending and financial risk due to Medicaid expansions, an estimated 9.3 million Americans who were eligible for Medicaid in 2017 were still not enrolled, including an estimated 2.5 million who lived in states that had not expanded their Medicaid programs.<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref> These findings suggest that substantial barriers to Medicaid enrolment might persist not only in non-expanded states, but also in expanded states. Understanding and eliminating barriers to enrolment is important for the long term success of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n",

In a period of increasing prevalence of fentanyl, the relative risk of mortality off OAT was 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.4) times higher than on OAT before the introduction of fentanyl, increasing to 3.4 (2.8 to 4.3) at the end of the study period (65% increase in relative risk).</p>\n",

      "          <p>Retention on OAT is associated with substantial reductions in the risk of mortality for people with opioid use disorder. The protective effect of OAT on mortality increased as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids became common in the illicit drug supply, whereas the risk of mortality remained high off OAT. As fentanyl becomes more widespread globally, these findings highlight the importance of interventions that improve retention on opioid agonist treatment and prevent recipients from stopping treatment.</p>\n",

      "      <p>Opioid agonist treatment (OAT), primarily with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone, is a safe and effective treatment for opioid use disorder that has been shown to suppress illicit opioid use and reduce the risk of death.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies conducted between 1974 and 2016 found that being on treatment was associated with a lower risk of death from all causes and from overdose.<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> However, the risk of death changed according to time since starting or stopping treatment and differed by medication type. Pooled analyses concluded that all cause mortality was reduced by a factor of 3.2 (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 3.9) when people were taking methadone and 2.2 (1.3 to 3.6) when they were taking buprenorphine/naloxone. The risk of death was highest in the first four weeks after stopping treatment (32.0 deaths per 100â000 person years on methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone), with a swift decline in the risk of death observed thereafter. These findings are important because people frequently stop and start these medications, and this exposes them to repeated periods of high risk of death. Excess mortality after stopping treatment can be explained by a loss of tolerance to illicit opioids during treatment,<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>\n",

A substantial decrease in the risk of mortality occurred after 12 weeks (standardised mortality ratio 7.3, 7.0 to 7.6).

In the week immediately after stopping OAT, however, the risk of mortality was 2.6 (1.9 to 3.4) times higher for methadone than for buprenorphine/naloxone.

The risk of mortality in patients on OAT did not increase as illicit opioids increased in potency. Our key finding was that the relative risk of mortality in patients off OAT was 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.4) times higher than in those on OAT before the introduction of fentanyl, increasing to 3.4 (2.8 to 4.3) at the end of the study period (65% increase in relative risk). The risk of all cause and drug related mortality was substantially lower in patients on OAT than off OAT. We also observed dramatic increases in the risk of mortality immediately after patients stopped OAT.

Our finding that OAT was associated with an even greater relative risk reduction after the emergence of fentanyl is unprecedented to date. A recent study in Massachusetts, a jurisdiction with a similarly high prevalence of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply, found that OAT was associated with substantial reductions in mortality among people engaging in treatment after a non-fatal overdose.<xref rid=\"ref36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>\n",

      "        <p>Our findings of a substantially lower risk of mortality on OAT compared with off OAT are consistent with those reported in other jurisdictions. A 2009 study of more than 40â000 treatment recipients in Australia reported a standardised mortality ratio of 4.5 (4.3 to 4.8) on OAT and 8.0 (7.7 to 8.3) off OAT.<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> These findings are nearly the same as those observed in British Columbia. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis reported a pooled all cause mortality rate of 11.3 and 36.1 per 1000 person years on and off methadone and 4.3 and 9.5 per 1000 person years on and off buprenorphine/naloxone, representing a relative risk reduction of 3.2 (2.7 to 3.9) on methadone and 2.2 (1.3 to 3.6) on buprenorphine/naloxone.<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> These pooled mortality rates are slightly different from those observed in our study (11.1 and 24.3 per 1000 person years on and off methadone and 6.6 and 24.0 per 1000 person years on and off buprenorphine/naloxone). This may reflect differences in the characteristics of people accessing each form of treatment, the total person years of follow-up, healthcare settings in which OAT is delivered, and clinical prescribing guidelines.

      "<xref rid=\"ref47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref> but they also contribute novel findings by direct examination of this relation after fentanyl became prevalent in the illicit drug supply.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We note several limitations. Firstly, the PharmaNet data extract excluded OAT administered in hospital and to federally insured people, including Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canadian Forces personnel, and veterans. The Medical Services Plan database may exclude some services delivered by physicians who were funded through an alternative payment method (contracted service, sessional, and salaried), as these physicians are paid whether or not they submit a billing claim. Also, these datasets exclude healthcare services and deaths outside of British Columbia. Therefore, misclassification was possible if a patient received OAT before moving into the province and died shortly thereafter or if a person died outside of the province.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Secondly, we were unable to distinguish cause specific deaths in the Vital Statistics dataset in later years. In total, the underlying cause for 690 (9.8%) of the 7030 deaths was âunknown;â 56.5% of deaths in 2018 and 12.6% of deaths in 2017 were still under investigation at the time of data extraction and categorised as âunknownâ in the Vital Statistics database. Therefore, a higher proportion of deaths on buprenorphine/naloxone were classified as unknown relative to methadone, limiting inferences on cause specific mortality across treatment modalities.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Finally, this study reports findings from a descriptive analysis and should be interpreted accordingly. Patients were not randomised to treatment status or to the specific treatment modalities examined. As a result, underlying differences may exist in patient populations, accounting to some degree for observed differences in the risk of mortality across strata. Sordo et al note the potential for confounding in comparisons of mortality risk on and off OAT in observational research.<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> Observed differences in mortality risk may be partially attributable to characteristics other than treatment status, such as severity of opioid use disorder, mental and physical health status, and lifestyle stability, which fluctuate over time and affect the decision to start and stop treatment.<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> Recent studies controlling for characteristics of patients and treatment at baseline concluded that adjustment had no significant effect on relative mortality risk or even increased relative risks comparing mortality off and on OAT.<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> In this study, we did not observe significant differences in measures of relative mortality risk after accounting for patientsâ characteristics. Additionally, differences in treatment delivery and pharmacological properties of specific OAT medications should be considered when interpreting study findings. This study was conducted in a universal healthcare setting, where nearly all healthcare is provided free of charge and all OAT medications are available in office based settings, which differs substantially from treatment delivery in other jurisdictions such as the US. Nevertheless, the consistency of our findings with the multitude of observational studies and randomised clinical trials in this field is reassuring. Further analyses accounting for possible time dependent confounding are needed to obtain an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of OAT on mortality and represent an important future investigation using these data.<xref rid=\"ref48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref>\n",

No published peer reviewed study was found evaluating the TeleSkin skinScan app. SkinVision was evaluated in three studies (n=267, 66 malignant or premalignant lesions) and achieved a sensitivity of 80% (95% confidence interval 63% to 92%) and a specificity of 78% (67% to 87%) for the detection of malignant or premalignant lesions.

      "      <p>Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, and the incidence is increasing.<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref> In 2003, the World Health Organization estimated that between two and three million skin cancers occur globally each year, 80% of which are basal cell carcinoma, 16% cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and 4% melanoma (around 130â000 cancers).<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref> By 2018, estimates had risen to 287â723 new melanomas worldwide.<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref> Despite its lower incidence, the potential for melanoma to metastasise to other parts of the body means that it is responsible for up to 75% of skin cancer deaths.<xref rid=\"ref3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref> Five year survival can be as high as 91-95% for melanoma if it is identified early,<xref rid=\"ref4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref> which makes early detection and treatment key to improving survival. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma has a lower risk of metastatic spread.<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref> Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma are locally invasive with better outcomes if treated at an early stage. Several diagnostic technologies are available to help general practitioners and dermatologists accurately identify melanomas by minimising delays in diagnosis.<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref> The success of these technologies is reliant on people with new or changing skin lesions seeking early advice from medical professionals. Effective interventions that guide people to seek appropriate medical assessment are required.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Skin cancer smartphone applications (âappsâ) provide a technological approach to assist people with suspicious lesions to decide whether they should seek further medical attention. With modern smartphones possessing the capability to capture high quality images, a wealth of âskinâ apps have been developed with a range of uses.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> These skin apps can provide an information resource, assist in skin self examination, monitor skin conditions, and provide advice or guidance on whether to seek medical attention.<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> Between 2014 and 2017, 235 new dermatology smartphone apps were identified.<xref rid=\"ref12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "      <p>Some skin cancer apps operate by forwarding images from the smartphone camera to an experienced professional for review, which is essentially image based teledermatology diagnosis. However, of increasing interest are smartphone apps that use inbuilt algorithms (or âartificial intelligenceâ) that catalogue and classify images of lesions into high or low risk for skin cancer (usually melanoma). These apps return an immediate risk assessment and subsequent recommendation to the user. Apps with inbuilt algorithms that make a medical claim are now classified as medical devices that require regulatory approval.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> These apps could be harmful if recommendations are erroneous, particularly if false reassurance leads to delays in people obtaining medical assessment. CE (Conformit Europenne) marking has been applied to allow distribution of two algorithm based apps in Europe,<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> one of which is also available in Australia and New Zealand.<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> However, no apps currently have United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to allow their distribution in the US and Canada. Further, the American Federal Trade Commission has fined the marketers of two apps (MelApp<xref rid=\"ref17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref> and Mole Detective<xref rid=\"ref18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>) for âdeceptively claiming the apps accurately analysed melanoma risk.â</p>\n",
      "      <p>These differences in regulatory approval and false evidence claims raise questions about the extent and validity of the evidence base that supports apps with inbuilt algorithms. A previous systematic review with a search date of December 2016 examined the accuracy of mobile health apps for multiple conditions. This review identified six studies that reported on the diagnosis of melanoma, but accuracy seems to have been overestimated because it included findings from both development and validation studies.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> In our review, we aim to report on the scope, findings, and validity of the evidence in studies that examine the accuracy of all apps that use inbuilt algorithms to identify skin cancer in users of smartphones.<xref rid=\"ref19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>\n",

Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or discussion with a third reviewer. Studies of any design that evaluated algorithm or âartificial intelligenceâ based smartphone apps that used photographs (that is, macroscopic images) of potentially malignant skin lesions were eligible for inclusion if they provided a cross tabulation of skin cancer risk against a reference standard diagnosis. Reference standards were either histological diagnosis with or without follow-up of presumed benign lesions (estimating diagnostic accuracy), or expert recommendation for further investigation or intervention (eg, excision, biopsy, or expert assessment). Studies that used a smartphone magnifier attachment were excluded on the basis that such attachments are relatively uncommon among smartphone users, and are more often used in high risk populations for lesion monitoring. Studies developing new apps were excluded unless a separate independent âtest setâ of images was used to evaluate the new approach. Conference abstracts were excluded unless associated full texts could be identified. Online supplementary appendix 2 presents a list of excluded studies with reasons for exclusion. We contacted the authors of eligible studies when they presented insufficient data to allow for the construction of 2Ã2 contingency tables or for supporting information not reported in the publication.</p>\n",

For diagnostic accuracy, each study would ideally have prospectively recruited a representative sample of patients who used the app on their own smartphone device to evaluate lesions of concern. Verification of results (blinded to the appsâ findings), to determine whether each lesion evaluated was skin cancer or not, would have been conducted by<bold/>using histological assessment (if excised) or follow-up (if not excised). For verification with expert recommendations, all lesions assessed by the app would be reassessed in person by an expert dermatologist. Data would be reported for all lesions, including those for which the app failed to provide an assessment. These aspects of study quality were assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool (QUADAS-2<xref rid=\"ref22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>; online supplementary appendix 3).

When apps reported three risk categories (high, moderate, low risk), we used the recommendations provided by each app to decide whether moderate risk results from the app should be combined with low or high risk results for the estimation of test accuracy. In cases of ambiguity, both options were pursued. Because of scarcity of data and poor quality of studies, we did not perform a meta-analysis. Forest plots were produced using RevMan 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Centre). We present data on a per lesion basis.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Main findings</title>\n",
      "        <p>In this systematic review of algorithm based smartphone apps we found nine studies that evaluated six named apps for risk stratification of skin lesions. Only two CE marked apps are known to be currently available for download in various parts of the world. Evaluations of apps with unknown availability and of those now withdrawn from the market because of âdeceptive claimsâ were particularly small and with highly variable results. Our review shows small improvements over time in the diagnostic accuracy of one currently available app (SkinVision) and a stark lack of valid evidence for the other app (SkinScan). Identified studies of test accuracy have many weaknesses and do not provide adequate evidence to support implementation of current apps.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Despite the limitations of the evidence base, two algorithm based apps have obtained the CE marking and are currently being marketed with claims that they can âdetect skin cancer at an early stageâ<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> or âtrack moles over time with the aim of catching melanoma at an earlier stage of the diseaseâ.<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> Under the EU Medical Device Directive<xref rid=\"ref35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref> smartphone apps are class 1 devices. Manufacturers can apply CE marking to class 1 devices as long as they have shown compliance with the âessential requirementsâ as outlined in the Directive,<xref rid=\"ref35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref> and without necessarily being subject to independent inspection by notified bodies such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom. Under the new Medical Device Regulations,<xref rid=\"ref36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref37\" ref-type=\"bibr\">37</xref> which come into full force by May 2020, smartphone apps could be in higher device classes and will be subject to inspection by notified bodies. The FDA already has a stricter assessment process to evaluate mobile apps by taking a wider perspective of harm where âfunctionality could pose a risk to a patientâs safety if the mobile app were to not function as intendedâ.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref> No skin cancer risk stratification smartphone app has received FDA approval to date.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Across the body of evidence presented, different apps recommended conflicting management advice for the same lesions.<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref> Additionally app recommendations commonly disagreed with histopathological results or clinical assessment, with some apps unable to identify any cases of melanoma.<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>The SkinVision app produced the highest estimates of accuracy. Therefore, in a hypothetical population of 1000 adults in which 3% have a melanoma, four of 30 melanomas would not be picked up as high risk, and more than 200 people would be given false positive results (by using a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 79%, as observed by Thissen and colleagues<xref rid=\"ref33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>). However, performance is likely to be poor because studies were small and overall of poor methodological quality, and did not evaluate the apps as they would be used in practice by the people who would use them. Selective participant recruitment, inadequate reference standards, differential verification, and high rates of unevaluable images were particular problems.</p>\n",
      "      </sec>\n",
      "      <sec>\n",
      "        <title>Challenges in evaluation studies</title>\n",
      "        <p>Firstly, smartphone apps are typically targeted at the general population with a relatively low prevalence of malignant lesions and a wide range of different skin conditions. Studies failed to recruit samples representative of this population. We found studies were based on images of suspicious skin lesions that had undergone excision or biopsy, and were further selected to only include conditions identified by the apps; for example, they excluded lesions with clinical and histological features similar to melanoma,<xref rid=\"ref34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref> or restricted inclusion to melanocytic lesions which are more likely to be recognised by apps.<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref> Such fundamental differences in the spectrum of skin conditions compared with the general population means that poorer accuracy is likely to be observed in a real world setting.<xref rid=\"ref38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref> Study results are also not applicable to people with amelanotic melanomas (accounting for 2-8% of all melanomas),<xref rid=\"ref40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref> or to identify other more common forms of skin cancers such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Secondly, image quality is a major concern for smartphone apps. Smartphone cameras are much more likely to be used in suboptimal conditions by the general population, which results in variable image quality. Even under controlled conditions, studies reported difficulties in obtaining clear images of large lesions, erosive surface of ulcerated tumours, mottled skin, lesions in skin folds, tanned skin, or multiple lesions in close approximation. These problems resulted in image exclusion and potential overestimation of diagnostic performance of skin cancer apps. The analysis of less than optimal images when used by smartphone users will further affect the ability of skin cancer apps to accurately differentiate between high risk and low risk lesions.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Thirdly, the lack of clarity in smartphone app recommendations could leave concerned users uncertain as to the best course of action. Reactions to a moderate risk result will probably depend on how risk averse people are, which will most likely result in variable decisions, with a risk of people failing to present to a specialist with a potentially malignant skin lesion. Therefore, predicting the true performance of the different apps in a real world setting is impossible without further research into behavioural responses in different groups of people with a range of lesion types.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Fourthly, algorithm based apps are constantly evolving. An evaluation of an app version and insights into its performance might not be applicable to the version available to users. Studies included in this review did not specify algorithm versions used for risk assessment and we do not know whether three studies of the SkinVision app<xref rid=\"ref29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref> considered the same app version or different versions.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Finally, the potential benefit of smartphone apps lies in their availability and use by people outside the healthcare system to evaluate lesions that cause them concern. However, all studies evaluated lesions or images selected and acquired by clinicians rather than lesions judged to be of concern to people using the apps. Concern exists about the impact of false reassurances that algorithm based apps could give users with potentially malignant skin lesions, especially if they are dissuaded from seeking healthcare advice. These patients are not represented in the reported studies and thus we did not evaluate this risk. A considerable number of users will receive an inappropriate high risk result that could cause unnecessary worry and a burden on primary care and dermatology services.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Algorithms within current apps can be improved and might well reach performance levels suited for a screening role in the near future. However, manufacturers and researchers need to design studies that provide valid assessments of accuracy. A SkinVision study<xref rid=\"ref41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref> published after our search was conducted reported improved estimates of sensitivity for the detection of malignant or premalignant lesions for a new version of the app (95.1%, 95% confidence interval 91.9% to 97.3%) with similar specificity (78.3%, 77.3% to 79.3%). The study has used some images and data collected by real users of the app on their own phones, however the selection of malignant and benign lesions from several different sources is likely to have introduced bias. Two thirds (195/285) of the malignant or premalignant lesions originated from previous studies (including 40 melanomas from one study<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref> and eight melanomas plus 147 other malignant or premalignant lesions from another study<xref rid=\"ref33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>), with images taken by experts on patients referred to a clinic. Another 90 melanomas were identified from users of the app who had uploaded histology results after a high risk rating by a dermatologist and a high or moderate risk recommendation from the app (which will overestimate accuracy if more easily identifiable melanomas were included).<xref rid=\"ref41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref> Clinical assessment by a dermatologist of a single image submitted online with no histology, no in-person assessment, or follow-up identified the 6000 apparently benign lesions included. Therefore, it is possible that this group might include some missed melanomas.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Strengths and weaknesses of this review</title>\n",
      "        <p>The strengths of this review are that it used a comprehensive electronic literature search with stringent systematic review methods that included independent duplicate data extraction and quality assessment of studies, attempted contact with authors, and a clear analysis structure. We included an additional two studies<xref rid=\"ref29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref> that were not included in previous reviews. We also excluded between three<xref rid=\"ref42\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref> and five<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> studies that reported the development (without independent validation) of new apps that were included in the other two reviews because such studies are likely to overestimate accuracy.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We included studies that verified app findings by using expert recommendations for investigation or intervention, in addition to studies that used histology with or without follow-up. Studies that used histology and follow-up are more reliable because the app assessments are evaluated against the true final diagnosis of study lesions; low sensitivities or specificities reflect the appsâ inability to identify melanomas or other skin cancers as high risk. Studies that verify findings against expert recommendations can only provide an idea of the level of agreement between the algorithmâs risk assessment and a dermatologistâs clinical management decision; agreement between the two does not necessarily mean the risk assessment made was the correct one for the lesion concerned.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Implications for practice</title>\n",
      "        <p>Despite the increasing availability of skin cancer apps, the lack of evidence and considerable limitations in the studies ultimately highlight concerns about the safety of algorithm based smartphone apps at present. The generalisability of study findings is of particular concern. Investment in algorithm based skin cancer apps is ongoing, with the company behind SkinVision announcing an investment of US$7.6m (Â£5.8m; â¬6.8m) in 2018.<xref rid=\"ref43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref> Subsequently, in March 2019,<xref rid=\"ref44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref> this app was selected to join the UK NHS Innovation Accelerator as a possible new technology to support earlier diagnosis and prevention of cancer. Therefore, it is vital that healthcare professionals are aware of the current limitations in the technologies and their evaluations. Regulators need to become alert to the potential harm that poorly performing algorithm based diagnostic or risk stratification apps create.</p>\n",

      "        <p>Future studies of algorithm based smartphone apps should be based on a clinically relevant population of smartphone users who might have concerns about their risk of skin cancer or who could have concerns about a new or changing skin lesion. Lesions that are referred for further assessment and those that are not must be included. A combined reference standard of histology and clinical follow-up of benign lesions would provide more reliable and more generalisable results. Complete data that include the failure rates caused by poor image quality must be reported. Any future research study should conform to reporting guidelines, including the updated Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy guideline,<xref rid=\"ref45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref> and relevant considerations from the forthcoming artificial intelligence specific extension to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement.<xref rid=\"ref46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>\n",

      "        <p>Smartphone algorithm based apps for skin cancer all include disclaimers that the results should only be used as a guide and cannot replace healthcare advice. Therefore, these apps attempt to evade any responsibility for negative outcomes experienced by users. Nevertheless, our review found poor and variable performance of algorithm based smartphone apps, which indicates that these apps have not yet shown sufficient promise to recommend their use. The current CE marking assessment processes are inadequate for protecting the public against the risks created by using smartphone diagnostic or risk stratification apps. Smartphones and dedicated skin cancer apps can have other roles; for example, assisting in skin self-examination, tracking the evolution of suspicious lesions in people more at risk of developing skin cancer,<xref rid=\"ref47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref50\" ref-type=\"bibr\">50</xref> However, healthcare professionals who work in primary and secondary care need to be aware of the limitations of algorithm based apps to reliably identify melanomas, and should inform potential smartphone app users about these limitations.</p>\n",

      "          <p>A range of attitudes towards pharmaceutical industry sponsorship were identified that are presented as four different types of relationship between patient groups and the pharmaceutical industry. The dominant relationship type was of a successful business partnership, and participants described close working relationships with industry personnel. These participants acknowledged a potential for adverse industry influence, but expressed confidence in existing strategies for avoiding industry influence. Other participants described unsatisfactory or undeveloped relationships, and some participants (all from general health consumer groups) presented their groupsâ missions as incompatible with the pharmaceutical industry because of fundamentally opposing interests. Participants reported that interactions between their patient group and pharmaceutical companies were more common when companies had new drugs of potential interest to group members. Patient groups that accepted industry funding engaged in exchanges of âassetsâ with companies. Groups received money, information, and advice in exchange for providing companies with marketing, relationship building opportunities with key opinion leaders, coordinated lobbying with companies about drug access and subsidy, assisting companies with clinical trial recruitment, and enhancing company credibility.</p>\n",

Patient groups that receive pharmaceutical industry money should anticipate they might be asked for specific assets in return. Selective industry funding of groups where active product marketing opportunities exist might skew the patient group sectorâs activity towards pharmaceutical industry interests and allow industry to exert proxy influence over advocacy and subsequent health policy.</p>\n",

      "      <p>Industry funding of patient groups appears to be rising.

There is evidence of an association between receipt of pharmaceutical company money and a proindustry position on health policy.<xref rid=\"ref12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref> Some patient group spokespeople have acknowledged that by entering into financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies, their credibility and their objectivity could be threatened.<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>\n",

      "        <p>We drew on the emerging discipline of empirical ethics,<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> which combines the use of empirical evidence and ethical theory to enable analysis of ethically important issues, and justify recommendations to guide future action.<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> In particular, we understand empirical research and ethics theory to be in a symbiotic relationship, such that each could and should inform the other.<xref rid=\"ref17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref> According to this approach, empirical methods are used to identify context by providing detailed information on what is currently happening and exploring the circumstances surrounding an ethical issue. Ethics theory is used to inform the research by, for example, identifying research questions and lines of inquiry, designing study approaches, and informing analysis and discussion of findings. Research findings inform consideration and conversation about whether or not what is currently happening accords with expert and broader societal views on what should be happening. This project was prompted by previously identified ethical concerns about the risks associated with industry funding of patient groups,<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref> which generated the research questions and informed the analysis.</p>\n",

Diversity of backgrounds and deep knowledge of industry influence in other settings led us and enabled us to focus on what might be similar and different about the patient group context.

Australia has a well established patient group sector, with many similarities to other developed, English speaking countries such as the UK, the United States, and Canada. Some groups in Australia focus on specific health conditions, while others focus more on general consumer health issues, including support and health service delivery for patients (often called âhealth consumersâ). By using Australia as our case study we had access to industry reported information about company funding to patient groups because the trade association for the prescriptions medicine industry, Medicines Australia, requires its members to publicly disclose this spending.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>\n",

We reasoned that diversity in these characteristics would allow us to obtain an understanding of the range of patient group experiences.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Our research group had previously compiled a database from publicly disclosed company reports of spending on patient groups,<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref> which we used to identify pharmaceutical industry funding of a potential participantâs patient group. This database includes the names of all patient groups that received money from the pharmaceutical industry, and how much they received each year from 2013 to 2016 inclusive (freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.25910/5bc67fed51798\">https://dx.doi.org/10.25910/5bc67fed51798</ext-link>). We divided the list of patient groups into quarters, according to the amount of industry funding they received. We aimed to include patient groups that received the highest amounts in dollars from industry (that is, groups in the top quarter of industry funded groups) and groups that received less funding (that is, groups in the middle and bottom quarters). To identify patient groups that received no recent industry funding we accessed the membership list of the Consumers Health Forum (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://chf.org.au\">chf.org.au</ext-link>), the key national body that represents patient groups in Australia. We searched for organisations not included in our database of industry funded groups and with no declaration of pharmaceutical funding on their website. We also carried out Google searches for regional groups loosely affiliated with national or other regional organisations that were found in our database of industry funded groups; followed up on suggestions from previous participants and colleagues (âsnowball samplingâ); and carried out Google searches for patient groups focused on a range of health conditions.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We approached 55 people from 49 patient groups by email; we used contact details that were in the public domain. We conducted sampling, data collection, and analysis iteratively, and our sampling strategy evolved as the study progressed to ensure that we had adequate variation of participant characteristics. For example, our initial recruitment efforts provided participants who were mainly working as CEOs in national groups, so in the later stages of recruitment we specifically targeted board members and groups with state or territory affiliation. We continued sampling until we reached thematic saturation; that is, until our analysis revealed no new information or concepts relevant to patient group interactions with the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n",

Use of telephone interviews when required meant that our study was able to include participants from around the country. LP introduced herself as a researcher interested in exploring the views and experiences of patient groups in relation to pharmaceutical industry funding. She asked about participantsâ experiences and interactions with pharmaceutical companies, including whether or not their group received industry funding, and their personal views on that. Interviews were digitally recorded, professionally transcribed, and deidentified. All participants were given pseudonyms to protect their confidentiality, and the names attached to quotes are pseudonyms. Field notes were written after each interview to record contextual data and reflexive thinking.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Data collection and analysis proceeded together; analysis of early interviews occurred during or before recruitment and interviewing of later participants.<xref rid=\"ref21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref> LP read all interviews repeatedly and made notes about salient concepts and ideas. The other authors independently read two of the early interviews and discussed interpretive findings from these transcripts together. The teamâs varied experiences and methodological expertise meant a range of analytic interpretations were generated, which enabled team reflection on the data by using a variety of perspectives. Any discrepancies or disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus agreement. LP used these discussions, her notes, and previous knowledge to develop an initial set of descriptive and thematic codes. LP imported transcripts and field notes into NVivo software and labelled all text with the initial set of codes.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Team members read and discussed in detail selected coded transcripts to check analytic interpretations. As data collection proceeded, emerging concepts and findings were discussed at fortnightly team meetings, and these discussions informed recruitment and interviewing of subsequent participants. Team discussions also informed new codes that were added to the coding tree, after which LP recoded older transcripts to incorporate these new ideas. At the completion of data collection, the team explored emergent concepts and looked for patterns within and across the full range of participants and groups. Codes were merged into overarching categories that described important findings within the data.<xref rid=\"ref21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref> We organised the findings into a conceptual typology that described and explained the data, supported by exemplary quotes.</p>\n",

So they actually really need the patient groups . . . even getting their logo, âsupported by whatever,â is actually quite a big deal for them.â When one pharmaceutical company tried to tell her group what they could and couldnât do she confronted them: âI said, âLook, this isnât okay . . . If youâre really not happy with the way weâre doing it, Iâm really happy to give you back your money . . . We will not be dictated to [just] because youâve been giving money.

For Helen, accepting industry money was âa threat to your independence or your ability to take a particular position.â She cited the experiences of colleagues in other groups who found that pharmaceutical sponsors prevented groups from informing members about competitor drugs: âThey thought they would be able to publish the material they wanted . . . on a particular form of medication, but there was push back from the pharmaceutical company because that medication they did not manufactureâ (CEO, general health consumer group, non-receiver of industry money)</p>\n",

These participants had a positive attitude towards industry and regularly received funding from selected pharmaceutical companies. They were comfortable with the collaboration and felt able to reject any company attempts to push their own commercial agenda. Many of these participants described access to new drugs for their constituents as an important priority, and one that they openly shared with the pharmaceutical industry.

These participants had positive or mixed feelings towards the industry. They were not approached by pharmaceutical companies and did not cultivate relationships with the industry. Four of the five participants explained that their situation had arisen because their group had different priorities to the pharmaceutical industry and were therefore unlikely to be of interest to pharmaceutical companies. Two participants were affiliated with a general health consumer group that did not have a particular disease or drug focus but instead aimed to promote and support consumer engagement in the health sector. The other two were affiliated with a patient group focusing on a disease that was primarily managed by non-drug means. These participants expressed an interest in considering collaboration with the industry if the opportunity arose. One of the five participants worked in a group that focused on health conditions for which there were actively marketed drugs, but did not interact with the industry because of the groupâs current policy against receiving pharmaceutical company money. This policy arose out of the groupâs philosophical commitment to financial separation from the industry, but the participant was not personally opposed to receiving industry funding and thought that collaboration might occur in the future if and when the groupâs policy changed.</p>\n",

One participant explained the incompatibility by saying, âIt would be very difficult to find an alignment between our due diligence on the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals and . . . their KPIs [key performance indicators] which are all about sales targetsâ (Euan, general health consumer group, non-receiver).

      "<italic>Relationship type D: âunsatisfactoryâ</italic>âfinally, there were some participants who were uneasy recipients of industry money (three participants from three groups). For two participants the unsatisfactory relationship was because of personal cynicism about the industryâs commercial focus, and a feeling that companies were primarily pursuing profit rather than acting for patients or patient groups. Sally (disease focused group, mid quarter receiver) reported, âIf they truly were in it for patient support . . . then they would get together as an industry and do something more proactive.â For Vicki (disease focused group, top quarter receiver) the dissatisfaction arose from perceived neglect from companies who had previously provided funding but had recently become less interested in interacting with her group. She said, âThereâs a company called [X], and they actually gave me a serve when they came and met me to say they hadnât felt the love from the organisation and they were decreasing the donation . . . We canât get anyone to deal with us anymore . . . you can call and call and call and call and no one ever gets back to you.â According to Vicki, [company X] was unhappy with the patient group because a community nurse, cosponsored by the company and the patient group, was no longer fulfilling the duties that the company wanted: âWhatever was transpiring with that nurse they hadnât obviously given enough feedback to [company X], and [company X] blamed us . . .

      "        <p>All participants saw that financial interactions between patient groups and the pharmaceutical industry would necessarily entail âgive and takeâ (Sally, disease focused group, mid quarter receiver). Participants said these were fundamentally business transactions, when things of value were traded: âThis is about asset exchangeâ (Robyn, disease focused group, top quarter receiver). If patient groups wanted to accept industry money then the group would have to offer something of value in return because pharmaceutical companies âdonât fund for no reason. They donât fund . . . just out of the kindness of their heartâ (Cate, general health consumer group, non-receiver) and it was ânaÃ¯ve to think that pharma companies are going to just give away money for public goodâ (Diane, disease focused group, top quarter receiver). While recognising a commercial driver for the interaction, some participants said that the industry staff they worked with were genuinely interested in helping out. They cited examples such as company staff who undertook personal fundraising activities for the group. A minority of participants said that companies could or should do more to help patients; they claimed that the pharmaceutical industry made so much money out of patients that they should give back some of their profits. Vicki (disease focused group, top quarter receiver) explained this way of thinking by saying that the pharmaceutical industry has a âcorporate social responsibilityâ to give âa percentage of [their] profitsâ to the âmarginalised or vulnerableâ patient group sector from whom âtheyâre making a lot of money.â</p>\n",

If weâre not a big slice of their market . . . then theyâre probably not wanting to put a lot of funds into [our patient group]â (Lyn, disease focused group, top quarter receiver).</p>\n",

      "        <p>Neil (disease specific group, top quarter receiver) worked in a pharmaceutical company at a time when the patient group he now works with was first set up in Australia. He described the impetus for starting the group: the company wanted to build âpatient awarenessâ and âenhance the actual understanding of the disease,â and âalso due to the fact that one of the first [disease related] drugs which actually made a difference came to Australia.â Since âpharmaceutical companies cannot go directly to patients or consumersâ they provided foundational funding to set up âthe independent consumer body to be in Australia.â More recently, according to Neil, financial support from the industry was shrinking, âin the past we had potentially, what, five, six companies with products and interests in [disease x]. Now we really have maybe one or two serious companies only.â According to Neil, the reason for this is that the drugs âare either not reimbursed or theyâre out of patent in Australia,â which would mean that cheaper generic products would likely be available, reducing sales and profit margins on branded drugs.</p>\n",

      "        <p>Many patient groups interact with industry and express varying degrees of enthusiasm and satisfaction with the relationship. Interactions are largely transactional in nature, with patient groups providing a range of assets such as advocacy assistance, marketing opportunities, and credibility in exchange for financial and in-kind support. Some groups work separately or in opposition to the industry. The timing and amount of interaction largely depends on the companies and the kinds of products they are actively marketing, with more frequent and substantial offers of funding going to patient groups when a company has a new product for which the group is a potential market. Thus patient groups have limited agency to engage in funding relationships with pharmaceutical companies: while they can veto industry advances, they are not able to insist on industry funding to support their activities. Frequent opportunities exist for interaction and multiple levels of interconnectedness.</p>\n",

We identify how, why, and when interactions occur. We explain the kinds of assets that are exchanged and expose unevenness in sponsorship patterns. Our results lay the groundwork for working with patient groups to better identify and manage any ethical concerns about existing relationships. Our study has raised the possibility that pharmaceutical industry interest and financial support of patient groups are tied to whether or not active product marketing to patients and advocacy to regulators are currently profitable. This area warrants further study.</p>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref> The patient group sector asserts its independence from industry funders,<xref rid=\"ref29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref> and so the mechanism behind the alignment of advocacy positions has been unclear. A variety of explanations have been suggested for this phenomenon and our work supports many of these, suggesting a multifactorial mechanism. For example, groups whose views and advocacy naturally align with industry might be preferentially funded by pharmaceutical companies<xref rid=\"ref30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>; industry supports the setup of new patient groups to assist advocacy around new products<xref rid=\"ref31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>; and some companies could exert pressure on patient groups to act in a particular way.<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref> Whatever the mechanism, there is a need to ensure balance and objectivity in the patient group sector with regard to advocacy around medicinal drug use.

The end result could be a patient group sector that is heavily focused on industry favoured issues. This focus could mean inequity in disease awareness and patient support, favouring health conditions that are amenable to drug treatment.<xref rid=\"ref34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref> Additionally, advocacy efforts might be preferentially directed at drug access and subsidy rather than prevention or non-pharmacological interventions,<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> and a research agenda that prioritises the study of new drugs.<xref rid=\"ref35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref> In sum, the unintended consequences of having a patient group sector heavily reliant on industry funding could be to prioritise industry agendas.</p>\n",

      "        <p>The strengths of this study are the depth and breadth of detailed information we obtained about patient group interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. A limitation is that we only spoke with patient group personnel and did not speak to industry staff. It is possible that participants misinterpreted some of the industry reasons and patterns around pharmaceutical company interest in interacting with patient groups. Although we spoke to a group of diverse participants who probably had a wide range of experiences and views, we did not cover all types of patient groups. Additionally we did not speak to individual patients or health consumer advocates who were not affiliated with any patient group, so we could have missed some issues or ideas. In particular we might not have heard the full range of experiences from participants who felt that they or their affiliated patient group had engaged in improper relationships with industry funders or had âcrossed the lineâ according to their own moral compass; these people might have been less likely to agree to an interview. Another limitation is that our study is based in Australia. Although the topic of patient group relationships with industry funders is of global interest,<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> there could be some local contextual differences that affect the ethical issues. For example, the USA and New Zealand have a unique context in which the pharmaceutical industry is able to advertise directly to consumers, which could lead to more industry interactions with individual members of patient groups beyond the scope of organisational actions. Furthermore, Australian pharmaceutical companies that belong to the umbrella trade organisation Medicines Australia are bound by a code of conduct.<xref rid=\"ref36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref> This code of conduct includes a list of principles and practices that guide relationships with patient groups, such as respecting independence of patient groups and not seeking to influence patient group materials for commercial interests. Companies in other countries might adhere to a different set of principles.</p>\n",
      "        <p>The database that we used to source relative amounts of pharmaceutical industry payments for named patient groups (eg, whether a groupâs funding level was in the top quarter) was derived from public reports. These reports contained data from pharmaceutical companies that were members of Medicines Australia over the four years from January 2013 to December 2016. The database might not accurately reflect the relative amount of industry funding during the time that we conducted the interviews (October 2017-October 2018). However, our review of the database showed that most patient groups tended to remain in the same quarter from year to year: 67% (38/57) of patient groups from the top quarter over 2013-16 were also in the top quarter in 2016; 95% were in the top or second quarter. In addition, some industry funding might have been missed because companies that are not members of Medicines Australia are not bound by any codes of conduct to disclose their spending on patient groups.</p>\n",

Our research provides details on the kinds of assets that industry funders have asked patient groups to provide in return for their support. Strategies to help groups mitigate conflicts of interest that arise from industry funding could include increasing awareness among groups about the kinds of assets they might be offered and that industry funders might request, so that they can discuss and prepare responses; improved transparency about industry funding of patient group activities; and education targeted at patient groups and their constituencies around the risks of industry funding, which draws on evidence from other stakeholders; for example, doctorsâ acceptance of even low cost industry funded meals could alter their prescribing habits.<xref rid=\"ref37\" ref-type=\"bibr\">37</xref>\n",

      "        <p>We are planning a meeting with patient groups to share our data, discuss the risks associated with receiving industry funding, and to develop standards and strategies for mitigating those risks. Educational materials are available for health professionals<xref rid=\"ref38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref> and these kinds of teachings could be adapted for patient groups. The authors have conducted public workshops to alert patient groups to the influence of pharmaceutical industry over evidence creation and use, and these could be rolled out to a broader audience.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Our results are also of interest at a broader health policy level. They show that the industry practice of selective funding for patient groups where active product marketing opportunities exist could skew representation of patient interests towards issues that align with pharmaceutical industry interests. Because the patient group sector plays a powerful role in advocacy and health policy development, including pharmaceutical policy, this could mean that the pharmaceutical industry is exerting unrecognised proxy influence over health policy. Strategies to help mitigate industry influence across the broader sector include more robust public funding of the patient group sector, and pooled industry funding to the sector.<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref> Companies could be required by industry codes of conduct to donate money to a centralised collection, independently managed and reserved for patient group funding so that companies and groups have no direct financial interactions. The outcomes of patient group activities might be quite different if the patient group sector were to collaborate and build a list of priority groups and projects, and had access to pooled industry funds that could be distributed according to that agenda.</p>\n",

Patient group interactions with the pharmaceutical industry are predominantly business transactions and groups receiving pharmaceutical industry money should anticipate they might be asked for specific assets in return. Selective industry funding of groups in which active product marketing opportunities exist is widespread. This funding could skew the patient group sectorâs activity towards pharmaceutical industry interests and allow industry to exert proxy influence over advocacy and subsequent health policy.</p>\n",

Interventions focusing on this group of providers are unlikely to effect beneficial change and could induce unnecessary burden.

      "      <p>Strategies to reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing range from broad policies or guidelines targeted at all medical providers to narrow interventions focused on providers prescribing high amounts of opioids. Broad strategies include improving medical school education curriculums and compulsory education of providers,<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> mandating the use of state level prescription drug monitoring programs, creating national clinical guidelines,<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> and lowering the default opioid dose in electronic health records.<xref rid=\"ref17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref> Targeted interventions typically focus on providers who prescribe opioids above a specified threshold. A common targeted intervention is the creation of âpill millâ laws, which typically require documentation of medical examinations and follow-up visits before and after the prescribing of opioids, mandatory registration of clinics with the state, or physician ownership of pain clinics.<xref rid=\"ref21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>\n",

      "</p>\n",
      "      <p>Targeted interventions do not require new laws. For example, one national pharmacy chain identified 42 providers, out of nearly one million, who prescribed excessive levels of opioids (eg, 98th centile for volume, 95th centile for proportion, and had a high number of patients who paid cash) and requested documentation justifying their level of prescribing. Of the 42 providers contacted, only six responded with medically justified reasons. The remaining 36 who did not respond or did not provide justification were no longer allowed to have their prescriptions filled at this national pharmacy chain.<xref rid=\"ref26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref> Alternatively, âlight touchâ interventions have been proposed, such as sending letters to providers whose prescribing patterns are higher than those of their peers<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref> or notifying those providers whose patients have had a fatal overdose.<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "      <p>Both broad strategies and targeted interventions are important for reducing inappropriate prescribing. However, effective opioid prescribing is nuanced, pain management is often complex, and there can be legitimate clinical reasons for a provider prescribing opioids in excess of recommended thresholds. Strategies to reduce prescribing can result in unintended consequences, such as misapplication, which could result in poor care or sudden involuntary discontinuation of opioids.<xref rid=\"ref29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref> Further, institutions and agencies responsible for enforcing or implementing these strategies may have limited resources and require additional information to prioritize strategies.</p>\n",
      "      <p>For these reasons, data driven policy demands a careful examination of opioid prescribing patterns over a broader range of time, geography, and population. Previous studies directly examining the distribution of opioid prescriptions among providers have been limited to geographically or demographically narrow samples of providers or patients, over shorter periods.<xref rid=\"ref30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref> This study seeks to fill these gaps, provide clarity to policy makers, and assist institutions with efforts to prioritize reduction. We examined a repository of prescription claims from a large, national insurance provider covering more than 60 million unique individuals from 2003 to 2017. The insured population includes all 50 US states and Washington DC and is of similar age and sex to the US general population. Using these data, we identified whether opioids are roughly equally prescribed across US medical providers or disproportionately prescribed by a small subset of providers, how prescribing patterns have changed over time, the extent to which top prescribers and top receiving patients persisted over time, and the relationship between high prescribing and top receiving patients.</p>\n",

Prescriptions that were filled but not dispensed (that is, not received by the patient) were excluded from the analysis to prevent double counting, which might happen, for example, if a prescription was transferred to, and dispensed by, a different pharmacy. Prescription level data included hashed patient identifiers, hashed provider identifiers (that is, Drug Enforcement Agency and National Provider Identifier), National Drug Code, quantity, number of days of supply, and date of transaction. In addition, we used the member, provider, and outpatient diagnostic files from 2003 to 2017. An Optum affiliate company assigns providers into one of 7106 categories, which are grouped into 308 specialties. We merged provider specialties into 16 larger, mutually exclusive categories: addiction medicine, anesthesiology, surgery, critical care, dentistry, emergency medicine, family medicine, general medicine, hospice care, internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, physical or pain medicine and rehabilitation, pharmacy, unknown, and all others. For female enrollees the median age was 34 years (50.5%, interquartile range 19-52 years) and for male enrollees 33 years (49.5%, 18-49 years). The age and sex distribution of enrollees in the Optum database closely resembles that of the general US population (supplementary table S1).</p>\n",

To test the robustness of our results to a high prevalence of low activity prescribers, we repeated our analyses with different levels of prescribing activity. Specifically, we removed all providers who prescribed fewer than 3, 6, 12, 24, 50, 100, and 200 prescriptions a year. To test the robustness of our results to the subset of opioids used, we repeated our analyses using only opioids designated as schedule 2 under the Controlled Substances Act. Schedule 2 controlled substances are drugs with an accepted medical use but with a high potential for misuse and that could lead to psychological or physical dependence. To test the sensitivity of the Gini coefficient, we estimated several alternative measures of inequality: Ricci-Schutz, Atkinson, Theil, and generalized entropy (supplementary materials section 4).<xref rid=\"ref47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref> Finally, in addition to standardized benzodiazepine and opioid doses, we analyzed the prescribing patterns for 18 individual drugs, with a range of therapeutic uses (supplementary materials section 5).

      "      <p>Promotion of cautious, scientifically justified opioid prescribing is an important public health goal. The US has started to make progress towards this goal in recent years.<xref rid=\"ref48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref> Policy makers use broad, tailored strategies to reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing. To understand the implications of these strategies, including unintended consequences, and to prioritize their implementation, requires a nuanced description of opioid prescribing patterns. Skewed opioid prescribing has been found in previous studies, although to different extents. One study carried out a smaller examination of a single state and another, was a geographically dispersed examination of the older Medicare Part D population.<xref rid=\"ref30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref> Our study extends these reports by examining a large, national sample with an age and sex distribution closely resembling that of the US general population. Additionally, this study adds detail by examining trends over time by provider specialty, underlying opioid type, and provider-patient linkages.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Our results clarify an important medical reality. Specifically, our results suggest that interventions targeted at high prescribing opioid providers should be prioritized for three reasons. First, most of the prescriptions written by the majority of providers are below recommended thresholds, suggesting that most US providers prescribe opioids carefully. Additional, potentially burdensome, constraints on this set of providers are unlikely to be beneficial. Because the majority of opioid prescriptions by this group are probably appropriate, any increase in restrictions is more likely to reduce appropriate use rather than prevent those of concern. Second, the top centile of providers is stable over time, which suggests that interventions targeted at this group will produce sustained results. Third, the top centile of providers accounts for a disproportionate number of patients receiving high amounts of opioids , and interventions targeted here will reach these high risk patients efficiently.</p>\n",
      "      <p>In addition, our results suggest that interventions must be nuanced and tailored. More than one quarter of providers in the top centile specialize in anesthesiology or physical or pain medicine and rehabilitation, two specialties in which additional training in clinically appropriate opioid prescribing is received. Further, a substantial fraction of the top centile of provider-patient pairs overlap in adjacent years, suggesting established relationships over many years. Extended relationships with patients could enable providers to have a better understanding of patientsâ needs and a readiness to taper doses. Lastly, the top centile of patients remains the same over time, which suggests that interventions based on improving patient care, management of patients with complex problems, and reducing comorbidities, rather than enforced interventions focused on rigid thresholds, are necessary to reduce demand for opioids.</p>\n",
      "      <sec>\n",
      "        <title>Limitations of this study</title>\n",
      "        <p>Our analysis has important limitations. First, our data were obtained from a single national insurer comprising mostly employer based, privately insured patients and may not be fully generalisable to the whole of the US. Second, the prescription data included only dispensed prescriptions and not prescriptions that were written by providers but never received by patients; therefore, these data represent a potentially biased subset of provider prescribing patterns. Nevertheless, these data covered a patient population closely representative of the age and sex distribution of the general US population (supplementary table S1). Additionally, when our data were compared with a careful examination of opioid prescriptions in California, similar results were found (supplementary fig S12). Third,<bold/>prescriptions attributed to one provider could have originated from care provided by a different provider (for example, primary care providers carrying out the treatment plan of a pain clinic). Fourth, opioids are a diverse set of drugs and standardizing doses into MMEs is necessary for comparisons; however, MMEs may not fully reflect the dependence, overdose, or mortality potential of different opioids. Sensitivity analyses using only schedule 2 opioidsâthose considered to have the highest potential for misuseânevertheless reached the same substantive conclusions. Similarly, benzodiazepines are diverse, and conversion factors for equipotency between different benzodiazepines have not been well studied. Importantly, our data did not allow us to assess the clinical appropriateness of any opioid or benzodiazepine prescription. Lastly, reducing inappropriate opioid prescribing is a worthwhile goal in and of itself; however, the opioid overdose crisis has shifted from prescription opioids to illicit opioids,<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref> such as heroin and synthetic opioids, which have mortality rates that are higher than those of prescription opioids and are increasing more rapidly. Therefore, the effect of strategies to reduce inappropriate prescribing on the opioid overdose crisis at large is probably limited. The recent increase in deaths from illicit opioids is, in part, an unintended consequence of reducing the availability of medically prescribed opioids, which has led some opioid dependent patients to turn to the illicit marketplace.<xref rid=\"ref50\" ref-type=\"bibr\">50</xref>\n",

      "        <title>Conclusions and policy implications</title>\n",
      "        <p>Our study shows that in the claims database of a national private insurer, a small portion of providers account for a highly disproportionate proportion of opioids. Further, these providers persist over time and are often linked with patients receiving high amounts of opioids. A corollary of this finding is that most of the prescriptions written by the majority of providers are below recommended thresholds. Specialties with additional training in clinically appropriate opioid prescribingâfor example, anesthesiology and physical or pain management and rehabilitationâare over-represented in the top centile of opioid prescribing providers. Lastly, we found that a substantial proportion of provider-patient pairs are linked over time. These findings suggest that interventions promoting careful prescribing should be tailored for, and targeted at, the top centile of opioid prescribing providers and focus on providing supportive care of patients with complex problems rather than seeking to enforce a threshold for prescribing.</p>\n",

Although improved survival among children treated in the 1990s compared with the 1980s and 1970s has been shown,<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref> the impact on the long term health of these individuals remains substantial, with most experiencing chronic health conditions related to previous treatment.<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>\n",

      "      <p>Contemporary cancer treatment has focused on advancing cure rates while attempting to minimize long term adverse effects. Patterns of exposure to cardiotoxic treatment have changed over time, with fewer children receiving chest directed radiation, with lower doses and smaller volumes for those who do, and an increased use of anthracyclines, albeit with reduced cumulative doses as the risk for late onset heart failure became apparent.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref> The impact of these treatment modifications on the spectrum of late onset cardiovascular conditions in cancer survivors is understudied. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, which includes a diverse population of survivors with a diagnosis across three decades, provides an opportunity to examine temporal trends in cardiac outcomes and the effect of changes in treatment over time. We assessed whether changes in exposures to cancer treatment in childhood are associated with altered risks for cardiac events among adult survivors.</p>\n",

Initially inclusive of survivors with a diagnosis through 1986, the cohort was expanded to include survivors of childhood cancer with a diagnosis over three decades, from 1 January 1970 through 31 December 1999. Additionally, a random sample of siblings (n=5057) of participating survivors were recruited as a comparison group. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire and up to four follow-up surveys. Cardiac outcomes are assessed by a series of questions such as âHave you ever been told by a doctor or healthcare professional that you have, or have had . . . congestive heart failure, a myocardial infarction/coronary heart disease, stiff/leaky heart valves, pericarditis/pericardial constriction, or an arrhythmia?â Details of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study design, methods, and characteristics of participants and non-participants are reported elsewhere,<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\n",

Survivors (median age at follow-up 27.7 (8.2-58.3) years) were younger than siblings (32.8 (0.3-62.6) years). Median follow-up time ranged from 11.0 years (diagnosis in the 1990s) to 29.5 years (diagnosis in the 1970s). The number of survivors exposed to chemotherapy containing anthracycline increased from 27.8% to 50.0% to 64.0% across the respective decades. However, those receiving higher doses (â¥250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) decreased from 16.5% to 11.9% from the 1970s to the 1990s, while the number receiving &lt;250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> increased substantially, from 11.3% to 52.1%. Exposure to cardiac radiation declined from more than three quarters (76.8%) of survivors treated in the 1970s to 40.3% of survivors treated in the 1990s. Nearly a quarter (24.2%) of survivors from the 1970s received a mean heart dose of 15 Gy or more, which by the 1990s had decreased by half (12.4%). Supplemental tables 3 and 4 show changes in exposure to anthracycline and cardiac radiation by diagnosis.</p>\n",

      "      <p>For the overall population, the cumulative incidence of heart failure at 15 years from cancer diagnosis was significantly lower in the 1990s (0.54%) compared with the 1970s (0.69%) (P=0.01) and the 1980s (0.74%) (P=0.01) (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f2\">fig 2</xref>). For coronary artery disease the 20 year incidence decreased successively across all three decades (0.38% in the 1970s, 0.24% in the 1980s, 0.19% in the 1990s). Supplemental table 5 provides the cumulative incidence of each cardiac outcome overall and by primary cancer diagnosis. The prevalence of each cardiac condition was relatively low but substantially raised compared with siblings (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f2\">fig 2</xref>, supplemental table 6). Compared with survivors with a cancer diagnosis in the 1970s, the hazard ratio of adverse cardiac outcomes decreased in the 1990s for heart failure and coronary artery disease (<xref rid=\"tbl2\" ref-type=\"table\">table 2</xref>). However, only the decline in coronary artery disease (hazard ratios: 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.77) in the 1990s and 0.65 (0.45 to 0.92) in the 1980s versus the 1970s) was statistically significant. This was primarily attributable to decreases in the rate of coronary artery disease among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (0.77 (0.40 to 1.45) in the 1980s to 0.44 (0.23 to 0.85) in the 1990s). Although the decline for heart failure did not reach statistical significance, the largest decrease was from the 1980s to the 1990s (0.73 (0.52 to 1.02), P=0.07, data not shown). Except for arrhythmias, the risk of each condition consistently decreased across the decades. The only population where an increase was observed was for heart failure among survivors of neuroblastoma (3.22 (0.83 to 12.53) in the 1980s and 5.72 (1.58 to 20.67) in the 1990s versus the 1970s).</p>\n",

The hazard ratios for heart failure and coronary artery disease suggested a decline over the treatment eras but were attenuated by the addition of treatment variables (mean cardiac and anthracycline doses) and cardiovascular risk factors. Risk factors associated with heart failure included female sex (1.51 (1.10 to 2.06)), higher exposures to cardiac radiation and anthracycline dose, and reporting a diagnosis of diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. For coronary artery disease a dose-response was evident with increasing mean exposure to heart radiation (2.26 (1.32 to 3.84) for 15-35 Gy and 5.86 (3.69 to 9.28) for â¥35 Gy). No significant association was found with diabetes mellitus, but dyslipidemia and hypertension (3.49 (2.11 to 5.77) and 4.75 (3.37 to 6.69), respectively) were associated with a significantly increased risk for coronary artery disease. High dose (â¥35 Gy) cardiac radiation and hypertension were associated with valvular heart disease (13.97 (6.01 to 32.48) and 3.12 (1.09 to 8.91), respectively). Hypertension was also significantly associated with the development of pericardial disease (6.35 (1.56 to 25.83)). Heart radiation greater than 35 Gy (2.74 (1.01 to 6.81)), high dose (â¥250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) anthracyclines (3.81 (2.13 to 6.80)), dyslipidemia (3.54 (1.80 to6.95)), and hypertension (2.59 (1.27 to 5.30)) were significantly associated with arrhythmias.</p>\n",

After adjustment for age at diagnosis, race, sex, BMI, smoking, exercise intensity, and modifiable risk factors (diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), the hazard ratios of heart failure and coronary artery disease declined over five year treatment eras. However, only the decline for coronary artery disease (0.80 (0.71 to 0.91) achieved statistical significance. This finding was attenuated by adjustment for exposure to cardiac radiation (0.90 (0.78 to 1.05)), suggesting that decreases in radiation dose or changes in modalities or delivery methods might account for some portion of the treatment era risk for coronary artery disease. Adjustment for exposure to anthracyclines did not attenuate these findings. These results are consistent regardless of whether the model used time since diagnosis or attained age as its timescale adjusted for age at diagnosis. The three variables are linearly dependent and thus only two of the three can be adjusted for in the model. Stratifying the mediation analysis by diagnosis (supplemental table 7) identified that treatment era attenuation in coronary artery disease by exposure to radiation therapy is largely attributable to changes in treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma (0.77 (0.66 to 0.89) without exposure to cardiotoxic treatment and 0.87 (0.69 to 1.10) after adjustment for cardiotoxic treatments).</p>\n",

      "      <p>Using the well characterized Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort, we assessed long term serious cardiovascular outcomes among survivors of cancer in childhood treated in the 1990s compared with those treated in the 1970s and 1980s, and found evidence suggesting improvements attributable to reductions or changes in exposure to therapeutic radiation. Contemporary therapeutic protocols, while modified to minimize late adverse outcomes, continue to rely heavily on anthracycline based regimens and radiation therapy to maintain successful cure rates. However, analyzing a broad spectrum of cardiovascular outcomes, we found that changes in therapies were associated with a decrease in the incidence of and risks for late cardiotoxicity among long term survivors of childhood cancer. Reductions in the use and doses of radiation have resulted in statistically significant declines in serious coronary artery disease among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma while declines in other diagnostic groups have been more modest. Notably, for survivors of neuroblastoma, for whom intensified treatments have been associated with more survivors living into adulthood, cardiotoxicity has increased. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, previously shown to significantly augment treatment induced cardiotoxicity, were also strongly associated with an increased risk for nearly all cardiac outcomes assessed in our young adult cohort; providing a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate outcomes for cancer survivors.</p>\n",

Reports of radiation induced coronary artery disease, both clinical and subclinical, and particularly among younger patients, further encouraged exposure to radiation to be minimized.<xref rid=\"ref20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref> Our study shows that reduced exposure to cardiotoxic treatment modalities have been associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. A reduction in the risk of heart failure was evident overall and among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma in our cohort but did not meet statistical significance, likely the result of the intensified use of anthracyclines during the same period that radiation exposure was being reduced. Notably, the risk for heart failure was observed to further decrease from the 1980s into the 1990s, suggesting a favorable trend. In contrast, Dutch investigators recently reported that survivors from the 1970s had a lower cumulative incidence of heart failure compared with those treated in the 1980s and 1990s.<xref rid=\"ref22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref> However, the temporal pattern of reduction in exposure to radiotherapy (defined as maximum prescribed heart dose) in Dutch survivors was of a smaller magnitude (with no chest radiotherapy ranging from 65.6% in the 1970s to 82.2% in the 1990s) than in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort (ranging from 23% to 60%) utilizing detailed heart dosimetry measurements. Additionally, we accounted for exercise intensity, reported to moderate cardiovascular outcomes in survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma,<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref> as well as traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, BMI, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Further longitudinal follow-up will be required to determine whether these apparent reductions in risk for heart failure among survivors from the 1990s achieve statistical significance with aging of the population.</p>\n",
      "        <p>While reductions in adverse cardiac outcomes were seen across the decades, the opposite was true for survivors of neuroblastoma, with a statistically significant fivefold increased risk of heart failure for those treated in the 1990s. This corresponds with the intensification of neuroblastoma therapy during this decade with the addition of myeloablative therapy, autologous stem cell rescue, and isotretinoin, which significantly improved outcomes for children with high risk neuroblastoma.<xref rid=\"ref24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\n",

Current studies focus on modifying the acute toxicities associated with delivery of anti-disialoganglioside antibody, but successful delivery of immunotherapy, for neuroblastoma or other diagnoses, might alter the rate of heart failure for these survivors in the future.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Therapeutic interventions for cardiac toxicity induced by cancer therapy remain elusive and have largely relied on strategies used in other populations, commonly with age related cardiac declines. The pathophysiology in our relatively young population (median age 27.7 (range 8.2-58.3) years), though incompletely understood, is likely different from that of the general population. Importantly, our study supports the evidence of the contribution traditional cardiovascular risk factors have for cancer survivors. Despite adjustment for personal factors, treatment related factors, smoking, BMI, and exercise, dyslipidemia and hypertension remained strongly associated with nearly all cardiac outcomes. When stratification was by exposure to cardiac radiation or anthracycline chemotherapy, similar associations with dyslipidemia and hypertension were previously reported in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort.<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref> We found that the risk persists despite adjustment for treatment era. Furthermore, a previous study identified a 2.6-fold increased risk for hypertension among survivors of childhood cancer of all diagnoses, and importantly, a high prevalence (48%) of survivors who were unaware of their hypertension.<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref> Although studies are underway to ameliorate or prevent therapy induced cardiac toxicity, more aggressive surveillance or treatment of traditional cardiovascular risks, or both, combined with modifications of upfront exposures, might further mitigate the rate of adverse cardiac outcomes.</p>\n",

      "        <p>Although the large population of childhood cancer survivors followed across three decades in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort permits assessment of trends in a variety of late cardiac outcomes, several limitations need to be considered. Despite the large cohort, 31% of eligible survivors chose not to participate. It is possible that the health status of these individuals differs from those who participated, thus potentially biasing our estimates. Cardiac outcomes are self reported, and validation was not feasible. To minimize misclassification, however, we restricted the analyses to clinically symptomatic cardiac events requiring drug or surgical management (grades 3-5). Our results should be considered in the context of declining all cause mortality in survivors of childhood cancer over the past several decades (1970-99).<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref> In view of this, we assessed whether the declines in risk over the treatment eras reported here differed from those in rates over the same period, the latter being unaffected by changes in competing risk. Specifically, we compared the era effect estimates from the Fine and Gray models (risk) with those from Cox regression models (rate) with the same adjustment variables. The two sets of estimates were almost identical, suggesting that although the mortality rate declined substantially over time, our findings were not appreciably influenced by it. Additionally, while we show improvement in cardiac outcomes for more recently treated survivors, caution should be exercised in the interpretation of the results, recognizing that this does not account for increased survival from childhood cancer or the enhanced awareness of cardiovascular disease after cancer therapy. Improved survival and health screening of cancer survivors could have identified more cardiac events. Our analysis included death from other causes as a competing risk, and cardiovascular screening is more likely to identify asymptomatic disease at a less severe stage, before becoming grade 3-5 and requiring medical intervention.</p>\n",

      "        <p>We observed that among adult survivors of childhood cancer the risk for coronary artery disease was significantly decreased. This decrease could be associated with historical reductions in exposure to cardiac radiation, particularly among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. This is important as childhood cancer survival rates increase and these young adults prematurely acquire cardiovascular disease. While additional longitudinal follow-up is needed to establish whether similar reductions in the cumulative incidence of heart failure can be confirmed in multivariable analysis, these results suggest that efforts to modify cancer therapies in children and promote health surveillance for survivors are beginning to show benefits not only in overall survival but also in late adverse cardiac effects.

The association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of fracture in offspring differed by attained age. Maternal smoking was associated with a higher rate of fractures in offspring before 1 year of age in the entire cohort (birth year standardised fracture rates in those exposed and unexposed to maternal smoking were 1.59 and 1.28 per 1000 person years, respectively). After adjustment for potential confounders the hazard ratio for maternal smoking compared with no smoking was 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.45). This association followed a dose dependent pattern (compared with no smoking, hazard ratios for 1-9 cigarettes/day and â¥10 cigarettes/day were 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.39) and 1.41 (1.18 to 1.69), respectively) and persisted in within-sibship comparisons although with wider confidence intervals (compared with no smoking, 1.58 (1.01 to 2.46)). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was also associated with an increased fracture incidence in offspring from age 5 to 32 years in whole cohort analyses, but these associations did not follow a dose dependent gradient. In within-sibship analyses, which controls for confounding by measured and unmeasured shared familial factors, corresponding point estimates were all close to null. Maternal smoking was not associated with risk of fracture in offspring between the ages of 1 and 5 years in any of the models.</p>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref> It has been hypothesised that smoking during pregnancy compromises accrual of fetal bone mass by decreasing intestinal calcium absorption and the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the developing fetus.<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref> In addition, constituents of tobacco smoke such as cadmium might exert direct toxic effects.<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> suggest that maternal smoking might have a long lasting influence on skeletal development in offspring, possibly through intrauterine programming of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis.<xref rid=\"ref12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref> Mothers who smoke during pregnancy could thus predispose their offspring to a raised lifetime risk of impaired bone health.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Results from studies investigating associations of maternal smoking during pregnancy with bone health among offspring have been inconclusive. Two studies from the Southampton Womenâs Survey cohort found a link between maternal smoking and a reduction in bone mass in neonates,<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> but associations with bone mass during childhood and early adulthood have been mixed, with inverse,<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref> These inconsistent results could in part be because prenatal smoking exposure only has a transient effect on bone development or due to methodological heterogeneity across studies and variation in adjustment for confounding factors.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Smoking is an exposure strongly patterned by socioeconomic and lifestyle factors that pass from generation to generation, and associations with smoking during pregnancy are subject to residual confounding by unmeasured shared familial characteristics when using conventional observational analysis methods.<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref> Two studies found associations of similar magnitude for paternal and maternal smoking during pregnancy with bone mass in childhood (measured at ages 6 and 10 years) and concluded that associations with smoking in mothers during pregnancy are likely to be confounded by shared familial factors.<xref rid=\"ref18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref> This reasoning is based on the assumption that confounding factors would relate similarly to smoking in mothers and fathers but that smoking in fathers would be expected to have no, or a much weaker, intrauterine effect than smoking in mothers.<xref rid=\"ref24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref> These studies, however, only explored associations with bone mass, and other aspects of bone architecture might also be important for bone health in childhood. We are aware of only two studies<xref rid=\"ref25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref> that have looked at the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and fractures in offspring. These studies found an increased fracture incidence during the first year of life<xref rid=\"ref26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref> and at preschool age<xref rid=\"ref25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref> in offspring exposed to intrauterine smoking, but they could not explore potential confounding by shared familial characteristics. Furthermore, residual confounding by familial factors might vary across the life course, and this has not been addressed by previous studies that focused primarily on (early) bone mass or fractures in childhood. Thus the impact of maternal smoking during pregnancy on the bone health of offspring during different developmental stages of life remains uncertain.</p>\n",
      "      <p>We determined the association of maternal smoking during pregnancy with fracture risk in offspring from infancy to young adulthood. To strengthen causal inference, we compared siblings discordant for maternal smoking to account for unobserved confounding by familial (genetic or environmental) factors shared by siblings.<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>\n",

Information on cigarette smoking is based on questions asked by the midwife at the first antenatal visit, mostly during the first trimester at 8-12 weeksâ gestation, and is recorded as a categorical variable (non-smoker, 1-9 cigarettes/day, and â¥10 cigarettes/day). Studies have shown that this self-reported measure of smoking during pregnancy correlates well with maternal cotinine levels (Îº=0.82), with only 5% of self-reported non-smokers classified as smokers using cotinine measurement.<xref rid=\"ref34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>\n",

      "        <p>Fractures were defined using diagnoses recorded in the Medical Birth Register (fractures in infants only) and the National Patient Register (fractures at any age) according to ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10 codes (international classification of diseases, 8th, 9th, and 10th revisions, respectively): ICD-8 and 9 codes 800-829 and ICD-10 codes S02, S12, S22, S32, S42, S52, S62, S72, S82, S92, T02, T08, T10, T12 (see supplementary table 1). This definition cannot differentiate delivery related fractures from fractures related to other causes. For descriptive purposes we grouped fractures by anatomical site (skull and facial, neck and trunk, upper extremity, lower extremity, and other) and mechanism of injury (non-intentional trauma; assault, including abuse; other or unknown mechanisms) using ICD codes and diagnostic codes for external causes in the National Patient Register (see supplementary table 2). Among 2253 fractures diagnosed in infants before 1 year of age, 252 were recorded in the Medical Birth Register, and of these, 213 were only recorded in the Medical Birth Register (that is, 39 also had a fracture diagnosis in the National Patient Register).</p>\n",

Maternal characteristics for each index pregnancy (maternal age at birth, parity, height and body mass index (BMI) at the first antenatal visit) were also extracted from this register. Parental marital status and socioeconomic measures (highest completed education level from the Education Register and occupational classification defined using an approximation of the European Socio-economic Classification (ESeC)<xref rid=\"ref36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>) around the birth of each offspring was derived from LISA.

      "        <title>Statistical analysis</title>\n",
      "        <p>Distributions of parental and offspring characteristics were compared between mothers who smoked and those who did not smoke in early pregnancy. Follow-up time in our study was defined from birth until the date of first fracture diagnosis, emigration, death, or end of follow-up (31 December 2014), whichever occurred first. To examine the association of maternal smoking with risk of fracture in offspring, we first calculated standardised incidence rates (per 1000 person years) of fractures in exposed and unexposed offspring across different ages at follow-up (one year intervals). Incidence rates were standardised by calendar year of birth to account for birth cohort effects in smoking prevalence and fracture incidence. Cox regression analysis with attained age as the underlying time scale was used to assess the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of fracture in offspring in whole cohort and within-sibship analyses. Because there was evidence of non-proportional hazards, we split person time by attained age such that associations were allowed to vary over time. Age groups were set using cut-off points that captured potentially relevant developmental periods: 0 to &lt;1 year (infancy), 1 to &lt;5 years (early childhood), 5 to &lt;15 years (mid to late childhood and early adolescence), and â¥15 years (later adolescence and early adulthood).</p>\n",
      "        <p>Maternal smoking was defined as maternal smoking in early pregnancy, and modelled as dichotomous (no daily smoking, daily smoking) or as categorical ordinal variable (no daily smoking, 1-9 cigarettes/day, â¥10 cigarettes/day), and we assessed dose dependent associations using statistical tests for trend. Three models were fitted for these exposures: 1) a model adjusted for birth year only; 2) a model adjusted for all observed potential confoundersâbirth year, maternal age, parity, height, BMI, parental education, occupation, marital status, and sex of offspring (the last could not be a confounder but is related to outcome, and adjusting for this might improve statistical efficiency); and 3) a within-sibship analysis. We used stratified Cox regression models with fixed effects in a multilevel framework (siblings within families) to obtain within-sibship estimates. These models with a separate stratum for each family include all offspring with siblings, but only families who are discordant on both the exposure and the outcome are informative for the estimation of hazard ratios for fractures associated with maternal smoking. We compared within-sibship estimates obtained from these models with estimates in the whole cohort (model 2) to explore the extent to which associations with maternal smoking were driven by unmeasured familial confounding. The within-sibship analyses were adjusted for the same covariates as the multivariable analysis in the whole cohort but excluding maternal height, a variable that is unlikely to vary among siblings in the same family. By design, the within-sibship analysis only includes offspring with siblings. To evaluate the generalisability of the within-sibship results, we repeated the conventional multivariable analysis (model 2) in offspring with siblings (n=1â234â922) and those without siblings (n=445â385). Sandwich estimator corrected standard errors were used to account for familial clustering in the analysis including offspring with siblings.</p>\n",
      "        <p>To assess whether associations between maternal smoking and fracture risks in offspring were explained by small size at birth, we repeated analyses with additional adjustments for gestational age at birth and birth weight for gestational age. Potential effect modification by sex of offspring was also explored for all associations assessed. We further examined associations with repeated fracture risk using negative binomial regression models. This analysis focused on the number of fractures experienced by offspring during the entire period of follow-up and was adjusted for the same covariates as the analysis for occurrence of a first fracture. A fixed effects negative binomial model with a separate stratum for each family was used to examine within-sibship associations for repeated fracture risk.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We conducted several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings. Firstly, we repeated the within-sibship analysis including full siblings only (n=1â142â936). Secondly, we evaluated the extent to which associations were influenced by the decreasing prevalence of smoking during pregnancy and changing diagnostic criteria over time by stratifying analyses by calendar period of birth (1983-91 and 1992-2000). Lastly, we explored the potential impact of missing covariate data by repeating analyses after multiple imputation of missing covariate data (see supplementary methods for details).</p>\n",

      "      <p>In this study, we found that maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with an increased incidence of fractures among offspring during their first year of life, with consistency in this finding between whole cohort analyses and a within-sibship approach, and with additional evidence of a dose dependent relation. The positive association between maternal smoking and fracture risk in offspring from 5 to 32 years of age observed in whole cohort analyses with multivariable adjustment did not display a dose dependent pattern and did not persist in within-sibship analyses. These results suggest that maternal smoking in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of fracture in offspring during their first year of life, whereas associations between maternal smoking and fracture risk later in childhood up to early adulthood are likely being driven by confounding by shared familial characteristics.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title>\n",
      "        <p>We examined the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and fractures in offspring from birth to early adulthood also using a sibling comparison design to deal with confounding by unmeasured familial (genetic or environmental) factors shared by siblings. The validity of fracture diagnoses recorded by the Patient Register is high.<xref rid=\"ref32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref> Other strengths are the size of this study, the prospectively recorded data, the range of covariates available, and the possibility to address risk of fractures during different developmental stages of life, as well as repeated risk of fracture. The use of national registers, resulting in a large unselected population with no loss to follow-up further supports the external validity of our findings. It should, however, be noted that our study comprises offspring born in Sweden, with only a minority of residents during the study period being of foreign descent (about 5.0-5.5%).<xref rid=\"ref37\" ref-type=\"bibr\">37</xref> Hence, results of this study might not necessarily be generalisable to other populations. Follow-up was limited to a maximum of 32 years of age, so we cannot make inferences about the influence of maternal smoking during pregnancy on risk of fractures in offspring in adulthood.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Several other potential limitations are also noteworthy. Firstly, information on maternal smoking during pregnancy was based on questions administered by midwives. Although results from previous studies support the validity of this measure of maternal smoking,<xref rid=\"ref34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref> this could have biased results towards the null as some women will not admit smoking during pregnancy or might underreport the number of cigarettes smoked. Also, exposure to maternal smoking was only assessed during the first trimester. Since women may give up or reduce the number of cigarettes smoked after the first trimester, this could also have led to an attenuation of potential associations. Secondly, this analysis only included fractures that resulted in inpatient or outpatient hospital care. Consequently, less severe fractures (not requiring hospital care) and unnoticed fractures were not included, and this will have resulted in an underestimation of the fracture incidence at any age. However, fractures requiring inpatient or outpatient hospital care are clinically most relevant. As the occurrence of undiagnosed or less severe fractures is unlikely to differ by maternal smoking, we would expect any bias resulting from it to have attenuated associations towards the null. Thirdly, fractures occurring at different stages of the life course might result from different causes. Before 1 year of age causes of fractures could include metabolic bone disease or osteopenia from in utero factors, genetic disorders, abuse, birth associated trauma, and other forms of accidental trauma.<xref rid=\"ref38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref> The relatively large proportion of skull or facial and femur fractures during the first year of life is consistent with patterns reported previously in infants,<xref rid=\"ref26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref> and suggests that a proportion of these fractures is due to birth related trauma<xref rid=\"ref38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref> among those susceptible to fractures because of brittle bones. Fractures later in life are also driven by hazardous environments and lifestyles to which offspring are exposed. Consequently, we might have underestimated the risks of fractures that are the direct consequence of inadequate skeletal mineralisation and suboptimal bone health with developmental origins. Nevertheless, regardless of the cause or level of trauma, susceptibility to fractures at any age depends on bone fragility.<xref rid=\"ref39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref> Fourthly, we did not have information on parental neglect, malnutrition, and physical activity levels in offspring, which could potentially confound associations between maternal smoking and risk of fracture in offspring in whole cohort analyses. Since these behavioural characteristics are likely to cluster within families, our within-sibship analyses will, at least to some extent, tackle residual confounding by these unmeasured factors. Fifthly, we found evidence of the smoking associated increase in fracture risk during the first year of life to be more pronounced closer to birth. We were, however, unable to analyse associations with fractures in neonates because of insufficient statistical power and the inability to differentiate between fractures due to birth trauma or to other causes. Lastly, the sibling comparison design also has potential limitations, including potential bias resulting from systematic misclassification of smoking discordance or concordance and confounding by factors that differ between siblings.<xref rid=\"ref42\" ref-type=\"bibr\">42</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref> To reduce this potential bias, we adjusted our analyses for several unshared familial environmental factors. Despite this, we cannot rule out the possibility that siblings within the same family experience different environments. For example, maternal smoking may be associated with temporary episodes of stressful life events or socioeconomic challenges that predisposes offspring to more hazardous environments than their siblings. This could give rise to possible residual confounding if these effects are not fully accounted for by the unshared familial factors in the within-sibship model. Within-sibship analyses are also less statistically efficient than whole cohort analyses, resulting in less precise estimates, especially during the first year of life when absolute numbers of fractures are low. We have been careful to focus on comparisons of the point estimates between the two methods rather than P values or whether the 95% confidence interval included the null value in the within-sibship analyses.</p>\n",

      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>In this study, maternal smoking was associated with a slightly increased rate of fractures from age 5 years up to 32 years in whole cohort but not in within-sibship analyses. This is consistent with results from two birth cohort studies that found similar magnitudes of association between maternal and paternal (measured when their partners were pregnant) smoking during pregnancy with childhood bone mass,<xref rid=\"ref18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref> which implies residual confounding by unmeasured shared familial characteristics rather than a causal intrauterine effect of maternal smoking. Also, the lack of a dose dependent relation observed in this study and in a previous study<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref> relating maternal smoking to bone mass in prepubertal children argues against a causal intrauterine effect. Conversely, reported associations of smoking during pregnancy with neonatal bone mass<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> and bone turnover<xref rid=\"ref46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref> have been more consistent. Our study extends these observations by showing the association with fractures before 1 year of age to be dose dependent and independent of both measured confounding factors and unmeasured familial factors shared by siblings. We found no evidence of maternal smoking being associated with risk of fractures in offspring between the ages of 1 and 5 years in whole cohort and within-sibship analyses, despite the larger statistical power to identify an association in this age group compared with the first year of life. These results suggest that maternal smoking only has a short term influence on the bone health of offspring, and that the amount of residual confounding by unmeasured shared familial factors tends to be less between ages 1 and 5 years.</p>\n",
      "        <p>A transient effect of maternal smoking on bone health of offspring during the first year of life is biologically plausible. Smoking during pregnancy reduces intestinal calcium absorption<xref rid=\"ref47\" ref-type=\"bibr\">47</xref> and influences the placenta,<xref rid=\"ref48\" ref-type=\"bibr\">48</xref> such that fetal development can be restricted through various mechanisms, including restricted blood flow. As growth slows postnatally and with maternal feeding ensuring more direct mineral supplies, the needs for effective bone mineralisation are likely to be better met after delivery.<xref rid=\"ref38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref> Indeed, it has been shown that by 2 years of age preterm born infants catch-up in growth, with bone mass being similar to that of infants born at term.<xref rid=\"ref49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">49</xref> Associations with fractures were independent of gestational age and weight at birth, suggesting that small size at birth does not explain these associations. As the association with fractures in early life appeared to be more pronounced closer to birth, this is also consistent with impaired fetal development associated with metabolic bone disease, a self-limiting condition that usually resolves during the first six months of life.<xref rid=\"ref38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref51\" ref-type=\"bibr\">51</xref> Our results suggest that such interventions could potentially also reduce the risk of fractures in offspring before 1 year of age. However, we acknowledge that fractures in the first year of life are rare and the difference in fracture rate observed with smoking during pregnancy was small (0.31 per 1000 person years). Although fractures during the first year of life generally have a good prognosis, these fractures can cause considerable parental anxiety and discomfort for the infant.</p>\n",
      "        <p>In contrast with the findings for fractures in early life, we found no association between maternal smoking and fractures beyond 1 year of age in within-sibship analyses, despite the presence of weak associations in offspring aged 5 to 32 years in whole cohort analyses. These findings suggest that these latter associations are not explained by a biological intrauterine effect of maternal smoking but rather by unmeasured shared familial characteristics. Smoking behaviour and bone fragility or fractures are complex traits that are affected by environmental as well as genetic factors, but no studies to date have identified the common genetic basis of both traits. Hence, the extent to which the absence of within-sibship associations at older ages can be explained by shared genetic factors is unknown. It seems plausible that unmeasured shared environmental factors, including lifestyle, dietary choices, and other social and behavioural factors (that predispose children in families to grow up in hazardous environments) mainly account for the within-sibship results observed in those aged 5 years and older. Although these findings are an example of family level confounding, the prevention of smoking in parents could result in improved long term health among offspring for other reasons.</p>\n",

About five years after winning, winners took significantly fewer weekly transit rides (â2.9 rides (â5.1 to â0.7); P=0.01) and walked and cycled significantly less (â24.2 minutes (â40.3 to â8.1); P=0.003) than those who did not win the lottery. Average weight did not change significantly between lottery winners and losers.

In this study we used the random assignment of permits for automobile purchase to households in Beijing, China, to estimate the relation between car ownership, physical activity, and weight.</p>\n",

      "      <title>Methods</title>\n",
      "      <p>In January 2011, to deal with the problem of congestion, Beijing capped the number of new vehicles allowed at 240â000 each year and introduced a vehicle permit (licence plate) lottery. After that date, only residents who entered and won the lottery were entitled to a licence plate. The lottery was drawn monthly, and winners had to purchase a car within six months of winning. By mid-2012 the probability of winning fell below 2% a month.</p>\n",
      "      <p>The sample was drawn from a group of households collected by the Beijing Transportation Research Centre. The research centre conducted a transportation survey of a random sample of 40â000 households from Beijing in the autumn of 2014, stratifying by district. The survey included questions on whether a household had entered the vehicle permit lottery. Among households with lottery entrants, a stratified random subsample was further surveyed in early 2016 with questions about the permit lottery. Because the lottery had many more losers than winners, sampling was stratified by winning status, with only one third of losers sampled. All lottery entrants in a household were surveyed.</p>\n",
      "      <p>The average household response rate in the 2016 survey was about 22%. Response rates were similar for winning and losing householdsâ21.8% and 22.2%, respectivelyâsuggesting that there was no response bias related to the exposure itself. The resulting sample comprised 180 winners and 757 losers. The sample size was considered sufficient to detect an effect of about 0.2 standard deviations in the primary outcomesânamely, transit rides, minutes spent walking and bicycling, and weight, with 80% power. The 2016 survey asked questions about car ownership, use of public transportation, minutes spent walking or bicycling daily, and weight, which are the key outcome variables for this analysis.</p>\n",
      "      <p>We used data from the 2014 Beijing Transportation Research Centre transportation survey, and found that 2016 survey respondents were broadly similar to 2016 survey non-respondents for many characteristics: household size, number of adults, number of working adults, number of children, household income, sex, age, and education (supplementary appendix).

Although data on the year of lottery entry and year of winning were complete, the exact month of entry (or month of winning) was missing for 251 (26.8%) of 937 individuals.

      "      <p>Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX), version 15.1, was used to estimate intention to treat linear regressions of different outcomes on an indicator for winning the lottery, with standard errors clustered at the household level. Lottery winners were intended by the policy to be treated (with car ownership), while lottery losers were intended not to be treated. Intention to treat analysis exploiting the lottery was important because most licence plates in Beijing were issued before the lottery and thus not randomised. Furthermore, trading or rental of licence plates on the secondary market has occurred.<xref rid=\"ref18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref> Thus winning the lottery is the only valid source of randomisation. Although trading in the secondary market is widely recorded, there has never been any suggestion that the lottery itself was corrupted. Owing to the public nature of the lottery, buying or borrowing a licence plate from an existing vehicle owner was a much safer strategy than attempting to corrupt the lottery administrators.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Winning the lottery was random, conditional on date of entryâparticipants who entered earlier had better odds and greater chances of winning. Thus all regressions controlled for a cubic function in date of entry. We checked lower and higher order polynomials in date of entry to ensure that results were not sensitive to polynomial order (supplementary appendix).</p>\n",
      "      <p>Because the survey date was approximately constant across households, variation in the date on which winning occurred generated variation in the time between winning and outcome measurement. Because the associations for some outcomes could evolve over time, we allowed interaction between winning and years since winning and reported predicted changes for an individual surveyed 0.1 years, 2.6 years, and 5.1 years after winning (see supplementary appendix for details). These values represented the minimum, average, and maximum times that had elapsed, respectively, between winning and being surveyed. Weight gain is strongly related to age.<xref rid=\"ref19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref> Thus we estimated separately activity and weight regressions for individuals over 40 or over 50 years of age (corresponding to the top half or quarter of our sampleâs age distribution) and tested whether an interaction between age and winning the lottery differed from zero.

Differences in physical activity became apparent over time. About 2.6 years after winning, winners spent 7% less time walking or bicycling than losers. At 5.1 years the reduction in walking or bicycling rose to 42%. These results, which use randomisation of the permit lottery, show associations with winning the lottery.

      "        <p>In the overall sample, the increase in weight of lottery winners was not significantly greater than that of losers by 5.1 years. Among individuals aged 50 or older, however, the increase in weight of winners was significantly greater than that of losers by 2.6 and 5.1 years after winning. To interpret these results, we note that the estimated 30 minute decline in daily physical activity for this subgroup translates to 140 kcal less energy used (1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ).<xref rid=\"ref22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref> These magnitudes are relevant because changing the energy balance by 100 kcal/day can prevent weight gain in many populations.<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref> Indeed, applying reported basal metabolic rate equations suggests that a 140 kcal decrease in energy expenditure a day would induce a weight gain of 10.3 kg by 5 years (see supplementary appendix for details).<xref rid=\"ref24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref> This significant<bold/>weight gain matches the point estimate of a weight gain of 10.3 kg at 5.1 years that we found for individuals aged 50 and older.</p>\n",

Although our significant point estimates were at the upper range of associations found in existing reports, several considerations deserve mentioning.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Firstly, many studies have focused on active commuting, but commuting accounts for only 15% of trips.<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref> Studies that examined car ownership or active transport for all trips tended to find larger associations. For example, Bell et al found that acquiring a motorised vehicle (motorcycle or car) was associated with a 1.8 kg weight gain in a Chinese sample<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>; Parra et al found that men in households with motor vehicles weighed about 10 kg more in Colombia than men without motor vehicles<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>; Dons et al found that Europeans who cycle daily weigh about 3.3 kg less than those who drive daily<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>; Smart found that giving up oneâs car was associated with a 3 kg weight loss in the United States<xref rid=\"ref12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>; and Turrell et al found that Australians who walked or cycled weighed about 8 kg less than those who drove.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref> The average association with various exposures across these studies was 5.2 kg.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Secondly, associations for younger age groups, although not significant, were smaller in magnitude. For example, for individuals aged 40 and older, winning the lottery was associated with a 3.2 kg increase in weight at 2.6 years, on average, compared with those who did not win. Finally, the confidence intervals for the significant weight associations were sufficiently wide<bold/>to include most estimates from previous studies.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Strengths and limitations</title>\n",
      "        <p>Our study used quasi-randomisation of car ownership from a lottery to estimate associations with physical activity and weight, but it had several limitations. As in most randomised trials, the study sample was not randomly drawn from the population. In this case, only individuals who were interested in buying a vehicle applied for the lottery. This population of over one million individuals in a major city with good alternative public transportation is nevertheless of interest because it comprises those likely to become car owners in the near future. Other limitations of the study included reliance on survey responses and limited geographical coverage.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We lacked information on other leisure time activity (beyond walking and bicycling), so we could not explore substitution effects. If some individuals responded to a reduction in active transport by exercising at the gym, for example, the total effect of physical activity on weight could be smaller than we estimated. Finally, variation in the time elapsed between winning and the survey date arose from variation in time at which an entrant won. If earlier entrants differed from later entrants, the interaction between winning and years since winning could partially reflect this compositional change.</p>\n",

      "      <p>Ground level ozone is a highly reactive, oxidative gas commonly found in urban and suburban environments, mostly derived from anthropogenic emissions. Numerous epidemiological studies and several reviews from health and environmental agencies worldwide have reported that exposure to this pollutant is associated with adverse health outcomes, including increased short term mortality and morbidity.<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>\n",

      "      <p>Short term ozone-mortality associations have been widely assessed in several multi-location time series studies in Europe, the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Asia.<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref> The general methodological framework consists of pooling location specific estimated risks, accounting for potential heterogeneity in the magnitude of the effect and uncertainty. In addition, the increased statistical power of multi-location analyses allows for the exploration of potentially complex features of the association (ie, non-linearity, delayed effects and harvesting, or differential risks by season).<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> However, previous multi-location studies included a small number of cities and countries, were generally of limited geographical scope, and applied heterogeneous analytical approaches and modelling choices, making it difficult to draw consistent and comprehensive conclusions across different regions of the world.</p>\n",
      "      <p>Although ozone-mortality associations have been widely assessed, results are rarely reported in terms of health impacts, such as excess deaths.<xref rid=\"ref12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref> Available figures are mostly derived from long term exposure metrics and risks estimated in specific subgroups, which are usually extrapolated to the general population.<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref> Quantification of health burdens from air pollution can be extremely useful for the design of efficient public health interventions, including the definition, assessment, and review of air quality standards. Current air quality standards vary greatly between countries, and only a few of them meet the stricter World Health Organization recommendation.<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> Comparting the effects on health of ozone levels above different air quality standards can provide valuable insights into potential public health benefits achieved by strengthening current clean air policies. Although a few studies have attempted to tackle this problem, a widespread evaluation across several countries, which would help to identify more affected areas with a greater need for intervention, is still lacking.<xref rid=\"ref16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>\n",

      "      <p>We carried out a multi-location time series analysis of mortality associated with short term exposure to ozone using data from 406 cities in 20 countries from multiple geographical regions. Next, we explored potential complexities of the associationânamely, non-linearity, mortality displacement, and seasonality. Finally, we quantified the impacts on ozone associated mortality of specific concentration ranges consistent with the current air quality standards levels and then compared these estimates across countries.</p>\n",

These include location specific daily mortality counts and environmental measures (weather and air pollutants) in largely overlapping periods from 1 January 1985 to 31 December 2015. For each location we derived daily time series of ozone (maximum eight hour average), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 Âµm (PM<sub>10</sub>, per Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>, 24 hour average), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 Âµm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, per Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>, 24 hour average), nitrogen dioxide (24 hour average), total mortality, mean temperature (Â°C), and relative humidity (%). Mortality was represented by all cause deaths in Canada, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, UK, and US, whereas deaths due to non-external causes (eg, excluding self-intentional harm, poisoning) were used in Australia, China, and Spain, and non-external causes other than unintentional injuries in Switzerland (see supplementary eMethods 1 for the specific international classification of diseases codes used in each country). City specific air pollution series were derived from daily measurements of one or more monitors of the national or regional network. When more than one monitor was available, we computed the daily level of each pollutant (24 hour average or eight hour maximum) as the average across monitors of the city, consistent with previous multi-city studies.<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref> We excluded 28 cities as a result of poor quality data or limited periods (less than three years), with 406 locations included in the final analysis (see supplementary eMethods 1 for a detailed description of the data, exposure assessment, and exclusion criteria).</p>\n",

Using this general statistical framework, we performed a set of additional and sensitivity analyses to investigate specific features of the association.

      "          <p>In the first stage, we performed city specific time series analyses using generalised linear models with quasi-Poisson family. In this type of regression model, to properly scale the standard deviation of the coefficients proportionally to the potential overdispersion, a quasi-likelihood is applied. This phenomenon is common in these types of data, when the variability is larger than that expected under the assumption of a Poisson distribution. We assessed short term ozone-mortality associations using unconstrained distributed lag linear models.<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref> These models account for delayed effects of time varying exposures and quantify net effects over a predefined lag period.<xref rid=\"ref20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref> For the main model, we selected lag 0-1, estimating cumulative associations with the same and previous dayâs exposures. The regression model included a natural spline of time with seven degrees of freedom each year, selected based on a quasi-likelihood version of the Akaike information criterion for 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10 degrees of freedom, and indicator variables for the day of the week, to control for long term, seasonal, and weekly variations in risk. Unlike in most previous studies on ozone, we applied a stricter control for temperature by using distributed lag non-linear models, an extension of distributed lag linear models for modelling complex non-linear and lagged associations. Following modelling choices applied in published analyses, we modelled the net temperature-mortality association over lag 0-21 (see supplementary eMethods 2).<xref rid=\"ref22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "          <p>In the second stage we pooled city specific estimates through a multilevel meta-analysis. This novel meta-analytical model defines more complex random effects that can account for variations in risk across two nested grouping levels, represented by cities within countries.<xref rid=\"ref19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref> This approach allowed the derivation of improved estimates of ozone-mortality associations at both city and country level, defined as best linear unbiased predictions. Best linear unbiased predictions borrow information across units within the same hierarchical level and can provide more accurate estimates, especially in locations with small daily mortality counts or short series. We tested the presence of heterogeneity and reported it using multilevel extensions of Cochran Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic.<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref> Association estimates, expressed as relative risk of mortality per 10 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> increase of ozone and 95% confidence interval were derived for each country from the corresponding best linear unbiased predictions.</p>\n",
      "          <p>Risk estimates for ozone related mortality were then translated into impact measures, represented by excess mortality, following a method described elsewhere.<xref rid=\"ref18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref> Briefly, for each city we computed the daily number of deaths attributable to ozone (or daily excess deaths) using the corresponding risk estimate associated with the level of ozone in each day. Regarding the latter, we used country specific best linear unbiased predictions instead of the city specific estimates to avoid imbalances due to selection of cities and periods within each country. City specific estimates were reported as annual average number of excess deaths and 95% confidence intervals, so allowing for a proper comparison between locations with different lengths of study period. Then, country specific impacts were represented by excess mortality fractions (%) computed as the sum of the city specific daily excess deaths divided by the total mortality for each country. We used fractions instead of number of excess deaths, as excess deaths are not comparable across countries given the dependency on the denominator (ie, total mortality), which at the same time depends on the number of locations included. Although no evidence of a âsafeâ threshold exists, we computed associated deaths only for days with ozone levels above 70 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>, as in previous health impact assessments.<xref rid=\"ref4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref> We considered this counterfactual scenario of 70 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> because ozone levels below this threshold could be mostly attributed to non-anthropogenic sources. A counterfactual scenario defined at 0 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> would not be appropriate either as it is not realistic given the ubiquitous presence of low levels of ozone derived from natural sources. We also disaggregated mortality impacts into contributions for exposure ranges above and between current air quality standards: 100 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> (WHO), 120 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> (European Union directive), 140 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> (National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in the US, about 0.070 parts per million), and 160 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> (Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standard (CAAQS) level 2).<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>\n",

Firstly, we modelled exposure-response functions with a non-linear function consisting of a cubic B spline with internal knots at 50 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> and 60 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> of ozone. Secondly, we assessed delayed risks and potential mortality displacement by extending the lag dimension of the distributed lag linear model up to 30 days. Lag-response associations were modelled using a natural cubic spline with three internal knots placed at equally spaced lag values in the log scale. Thirdly, we assessed seasonal differences through interaction models between an indicator of season and the distributed lag linear model of ozone, as described elsewhere.<xref rid=\"ref24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref> We derived the ozone-mortality risk for the warm season (June to August in the northern hemisphere, December, January, and February in the southern hemisphere) and cold seasons (the remaining months).</p>\n",

We then assessed the exclusion of a subset of US cities with data for summer only, which were included in the main analysis, and then different modelling approaches to control for temperature.

      "<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f3\">Figure 3</xref> depicts the excess mortality fractions above the WHO guideline and their distribution across intervals between the other air quality standards for each country, whereas supplementary eTable 3 and eTable 4 report the corresponding figures for excess fractions for total ozone (&gt;70 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>) and above and between air quality standards. <xref rid=\"tbl2\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 2</xref> shows fractions and annual number of excess deaths associated with ozone for the total range of exposure and above the WHO guideline for a selection of the main cities in each country and overall across the 406 locations (supplementary eTable5 shows the estimates for all cities). Total mortality associated with ozone greater than 70 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> accounted for 0.26% of deaths (95% confidence interval 0.24% to 0.28%), which translates into 8203 annual excess deaths (95% confidence interval 3525 to 12â840) across the 406 locations studied (<xref rid=\"tbl2\" ref-type=\"table\">table 2</xref>). A substantial residual excess mortality of 0.20% (95% confidence interval 0.18% to 0.22%) corresponding to 6262 (95% confidence interval 1413 to 11â065) annual excess deaths remained when restricting to days with levels above the WHO guideline of 100 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>. This proportion varied greatly by country, with considerably larger fractions in Mexico (0.52% (0.14% to 0.92%)) and Taiwan (0.37% (0.08% to 0.64%)) (fig 3, supplementary eTable 3). A mortality excess around 0.20% was estimated in Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, and the US, whereas France, Germany, South Korea, and the UK reported smaller percentages, ranging between 0.14% and 0.05% (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f3\">fig 3</xref>, supplementary eTable 3). Imprecise or almost null estimates were found in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden (supplementary eTable 3). Overall mortality fractions above more lenient air quality standards (ie, the European Union, NAAQS, and CAAQS) decreased progressively to 0.14%, 0.09%, and 0.05%, respectively (supplementary eTable 3). Only Mexico reported a considerably higher fraction, of 0.35% above the highest air quality standards of 160 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>, although this finding was highly uncertain (black bar in <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f3\">fig 3, </xref>supplementary eTable 3). Null excess deaths were found in Australia, as daily exposure levels were all below 70 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>. A similar pattern was found across estimates for the main cities in each country (<xref rid=\"tbl2\" ref-type=\"table\">table 2</xref>). A substantial number of annual excess deaths were associated with ozone levels above the WHO guidelineânamely, 694 (95% confidence interval 22 to 1317) in the Valley of Mexico, 211 (112 to 307) in Los Angeles, 170 (40 to 304) in Tokyo, 128 (59 to 197) in Toronto, 82 (19 to 148) in Johannesburg, 48 (0 to 96) in Paris, and 37 (15 to 57) in London (<xref rid=\"tbl2\" ref-type=\"table\">table 2</xref>).

      "      <p>Our results showed important differences in the ozone-mortality association across countries. For example, while some areas such as UK, South Africa, Canada, and Estonia reported the largest risk estimates above 1.0020, smaller or imprecise estimates below 1.0011 were found in Greece, Mexico, Spain, and Taiwan. This unclear pattern would suggest that although several community level factors have been proposed as potential modifiers in single country studies (eg, population characteristics), these might not fully characterise differences between countries.<xref rid=\"ref30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref> Future multi-country studies are needed to provide further evidence on the factors defining the level of vulnerability of a population to air pollution.</p>\n",
      "      <p>This study also provides evidence on the potential public health benefits of stricter clean air policies. In particular, we found that 0.20% excess mortality, which translates into more than 6000 deaths each year, related to short term exposure to ozone could have been avoided if ambient levels were below the WHO guideline of 100 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> in the 406 cities included in the study. Recent reviews found that most of the current air quality standards do not comply with the WHO air quality guideline,<xref rid=\"ref15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref> and that 80% of the worldâs population in urban areas are exposed to air pollution levels above this threshold.<xref rid=\"ref31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref> Moreover, an additional 0.06% of excess deaths is associated with ozone levels between 70 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> and 100 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>. These findings support the WHO initiative of encouraging countries to reconsider current air quality standards and enforce stronger emission restrictions and other public health interventions to meet its recommendations. Additionally, our results have important implications for healthcare practice. Apart from the implementation of clean air policies, individual strategies to reduce personal exposure to air pollutants are also desirable.<xref rid=\"ref32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref> In this regard, clinicians play an important role in counselling patients with potentially a higher susceptibility to adverse health outcomes related to air pollution. For example, professionals can advise sensitive individuals to stay indoors or avoid doing exercise during episodes of high ambient ozone.</p>\n",

For example, we found that 0.52% of total mortality in Mexico was associated with ozone above the WHO limit, the largest mortality fraction among the studied countries. This was associated with the highest ozone levels registered in the Mexican cities, especially above the 160 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup> limit, which is close to its current air quality standards of 156 Âµg/m<sup>3</sup>. This means that attaining the current lenient standards would prevent a substantial proportion of ozone related deaths in this country. In contrast, results for the UK show a lower mortality fraction, despite the strongest ozone-mortality association, owing to the lower ozone levels registered in this country.</p>\n",

In addition, we provided ozone related impact estimates, quantified as excess mortality, across different air quality standards, countries and cities, providing evidence with important public health implications.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We were able to explore additional complexities of the association by taking advantage of the large statistical power and advanced statistical techniques. Firstly, our results support the conclusions of previous studies on a generally linear concentration-response functions, with no indication of threshold.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref> Secondly, we found evidence of a potential mortality displacement in the third and fourth week after the exposure. A similar lag pattern has been previously observed.<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> However, potential mechanisms explaining this delayed and sustained pattern remain unclear.

      "        <p>This study has some limitations. Firstly, our results should not be considered truly global estimates, because several areas of the world such as South America, Africa, and the Middle East are unrepresented or were not assessed. In addition, the reported nationwide results might not be representative of the true impacts for some countries with a limited number of cities included in the study (eg, Sweden, Czech Republic, China). In particular, the estimated number of total excess deaths attributed to ozone should be interpreted as the sum of impacts in the 406 observed locations and not as total estimates across the 20 countries. Although excess fractions could be considered proper representations of the impacts for each country, the total excess number of deaths for each country is highly dependent on the total mortality considered in the studyâthat is, the number of locations included in each country. Systematic differences could also exist between countries in the characteristics of monitors (type, proximity to study area), study area boundaries, temporal coverage, data processing before data collection, and the collection of mortality data (eg, case ascertainment, codification). However, we ensured that the data fulfilled a minimum set of requirements for quality, a similar definition for the eight hour maximum metric, and location of the monitor (ie, within the study area or close enough to ensure its representativeness). Risks and impact estimates were only reported for total mortality (ie, deaths due to all or non-external causes) and we did not seek to identify the sources of heterogeneity of the results across countries. We acknowledge that the applied approach prevents us from understanding the potential mechanisms or differential susceptibility of the population, together with contextual differences across locations. Further studies are warranted to clarify this complex research question, including, for example, cause specific mortality and morbidity, and more complex two stage analyses. Finally, although the risk estimates were small they apply to the whole population, thus translating into substantial mortality impacts as shown in our estimates of excess mortality. By the same token, owing to the nature of the study design (time series analysis) the obtained excess mortality estimates refer to transient impact measures and not to the mortality burden or person years of life lost attributed to chronic exposure to ozone.<xref rid=\"ref33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>\n",

      "        <p>This large multi-country study provided evidence on the short term association between ozone and mortality. We also show that clean air policies with the enactment of air quality standards can constitute essential public health tools to minimise the health burden. In particular, our results suggest that ozone related health impacts can be largely preventable by attaining effective air quality standards in line with the WHO guideline. Moreover, interventions to further reduce ozone pollution would provide additional health benefits, even in regions that meet current regulatory standards and guidelines. These findings have important implications for the design of future public health actions; particularly, for example, in relation to the implementation of mitigation strategies to reduce the impacts of climate change.</p>\n",

The HPFS was established in 1986, when 51â529 male US health professionals (dentists, optometrists, osteopaths, podiatrists, pharmacists, and veterinarians) aged 40-75 years completed a mailed questionnaire about their medical history and lifestyle.<xref rid=\"ref25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref> In both cohorts, self administered questionnaires have been sent every two years to update the information and identify newly diagnosed cases of various diseases. For this analysis, we used 1980 as the baseline for the NHS and 1986 for the HPFS. We excluded participants already diagnosed as having any of the three outcomes (cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, n=15â118), those with implausible energy intakes (women: &lt;500 or &gt;3500 kcal/day; men: &lt;800 or &gt;4200 kcal/day), and those with missing values for body mass index, physical activity, alcohol, or smoking at baseline (n=17â317), leaving 111â562 participants (73â196 women and 38â366 men) for analysis.

      "        <p>We derived a healthy lifestyle score based on information on five lifestyle factorsâdiet, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and body mass index (BMI). Diet was assessed in the NHS and HPFS by using a validated food frequency questionnaire assessing how often, on average, a participant had consumed a specified amount of a list of foods during the previous year.<xref rid=\"ref24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref> Quality of diet was assessed using the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) score, which is significantly associated with risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases in the general population.<xref rid=\"ref26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref> We defined a healthy diet as an AHEI score in the top 40% of each cohort distribution.<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref> Physical activity levels were assessed using a validated questionnaire and updated every two to four years.<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref> We estimated the number of hours per week spent in moderate to vigorous activities (including brisk walking) requiring the expenditure of at least 3 metabolic equivalents of task (METs) per hour. We classified low risk as at least 30 minutes of moderate or vigorous activity daily (3.5 h/week). Height and weight were self reported and used to calculate BMI as weight (kg) divided by height (m<sup>2</sup>). We defined a healthy body weight as a BMI in the range of 18.5-24.9.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Self reported smoking status and the number of cigarettes smoked were updated biennially. We defined never smokers as participants who reported never smoking, current smokers as participants who reported active smoking on the questionnaire, and ever smokers as participants who had smoked in the past but did not report active smoking on the time varying questionnaire. On each questionnaire, current smokers were further classified as smoking one to 14, 15 to 24, or 25 or more cigarettes per day. The food frequency questionnaire also collected alcoholic beverage consumption, including red and white wine separately (4 ounces, increasing to 5 ounces in 2006), beer (one glass, can, or bottle), and liquor (one drink or shot). We multiplied the amount of alcohol in grams per specified portion size by servings per day, determined the midpoint of the frequency category, and summed across all beverages to estimate the average alcohol consumption (g/day). We defined moderate alcohol consumption as 5-15 g/day for women and 5-30 g/day for men, consistent with the guidelines for moderate alcohol intake in the US.<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>\n",

      "        <p>For each low risk lifestyle factor, the participant received a score of 1 if he or she met the criterion for low risk, and 0 otherwise. The sum of these five scores together gave a final low risk lifestyle score ranging from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a healthier lifestyle. As the number of cases among the group with the highest lifestyle score was small, especially mortality among participants with prevalent diseases, we combined participants with four or five low risk factors into one group.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Because lifestyle factors may affect mortality risk over an extended period of time, to best represent long term lifestyle we applied time varying lifestyle information during follow-up, in which mortality risks were predicted by the repeated measurements of these variables during the follow-up periods. The average response rate for the lifestyle risk factors during follow-up was approximately 94% for the NHS and 90% for the HPFS. We calculated average levels of lifestyle factors by using the latest two repeated measurements for our primary analysis of diet, physical activity, and alcohol consumption.<xref rid=\"ref35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref> For non-respondents to both questionnaires, we used the last available value carried forward. For AHEI score and alcohol consumption, we calculated the average on the basis of four year repeated measurements. Smoking status was estimated on the basis of both smoking history and most recent status updated every two years and classified into five categories: never smoking, past smoking, and current smoking of 1-14, 15-24, and 25 or more cigarettes per day. To minimize reverse causality, we applied the lifelong maximum BMI by age at risk.<xref rid=\"ref36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref> For example, we applied the maximum value of BMI at age 18 and BMI in 1980 to predict mortality between 1980 and 1982 and the maximum value of BMI at age 18, BMI in 1980, and BMI in 1982 to predict mortality between 1982 and 1984, and so forth.</p>\n",

Study physicians, blinded to exposure information, reviewed medical records to confirm the diagnosis. We included all cancers as outcomes except non-melanoma skin cancer. Non-fatal cardiovascular disease outcomes comprised non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. We classified non-fatal myocardial infarctions as confirmed if the criteria of the World Health Organization were met specifically on the basis of symptoms and either electrocardiographic changes or elevated cardiac enzyme concentrations. We classified stroke cases according to the criteria of the National Survey of Stroke, which required evidence of a neurologic deficit with a sudden or rapid onset that persisted for more than 24 hours. Pathologically confirmed cerebrovascular conditions that were caused by an infection, trauma, or malignancy were not counted as outcomes. Cancer, coronary heart disease, and stroke events for which confirmatory information was obtained by interview or letter but without access to medical records were also included as outcomes.

      "        <p>We used population based multistate life tables to calculate the differences in life expectancy and years lived with and without major chronic diseases for each lifestyle factor and the total lifestyle factor score. To assess the association between the number of low risk factors and life expectancy free of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, we took into account three states (disease free, presence of disease, and death), and three transitions between states (from non-disease to incident disease, from non-disease to mortality among participants free of major chronic disease, and from disease diagnosis to mortality among those with disease). Subsequently, we built multistate life tables allowing for the occurrence of the transitions. As shown in supplementary figure A, all participants started from state 0 at baseline; both the period between state 0 and state 1 (before disease diagnosis) and the period between state 0 and state 2 (without disease) contributed to the estimated life expectancy free of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes; whereas only the patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes after diagnosis (from state 1 to state 2) contributed to the estimated life expectancy in the presence of the major chronic disease.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We built a total of four multistate life tablesâone for a combination of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes and three for individual diseases.

We considered only the first entry into a state and no subsequent disease event, and no reversal of state was allowed. Secondly, we calculated hazard ratios to assess the relation between the number of low risk factors and the three transitions by using Cox proportional hazards analyses. We used separate time varying Cox proportional hazards models to assess the risk of mortality without disease, risk of incident disease, and risk of mortality among participants with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Thirdly, we calculated proportions of low risk factors among the sub-study population for each transition. Lastly, we used the hazard ratios combined with the overall transition rates and low risk factor proportions in the multistate life table to calculate total life expectancy and life expectancy with and without diseases for each group of low risk factors. The multistate life tables started at age 50 years and closed at age 105 years. Models were adjusted for age, ethnicity, current multivitamin use, current aspirin use, status with regard to a family history of diabetes, myocardial infarction, or cancer, and, for women, menopausal status and hormone use.</p>\n",

Compared with those with zero low risk lifestyle factors, men and women with four or five low risk factors had a lower rate of incident cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, and they also lived longer after diagnosis of these diseases. This resulted in a paradoxical non-differential life expectancy in the presence of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes across groups with different numbers of healthy lifestyle factors.

Nevertheless, we also acknowledge several limitations. Firstly, this study was limited by its reliance on self reported lifestyle factors; measurement errors are inevitable. The use of prospectively collected, cumulatively averaged values based on repeated assessments would reduce the effect of random measurement errors. Secondly, residual and unmeasured confounding might also exist even though we controlled for a wide range of potential confounders. However, only a very strong unmeasured risk factor for mortality together with a very large prevalence imbalance among exposure groups could explain such strong findings.<xref rid=\"ref43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref> Thirdly, we included only cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes because these are highly prevalent diseases, accounting for most chronic diseases, and their associations with lifestyle factors are well documented. The calculated âdisease-freeâ life expectancy would change if we included other diseases, such as respiratory disease or kidney disease; however, the relative differences in disease-free life expectancy across different lifestyle groups should not materially change. Similarly, we did not take into account the severity and clinical complications of the diseases, which could have affected life expectancies. Fourthly, people may have changed their lifestyle after diagnosis of diseases. Nevertheless, our sensitivity analysis taking into account this potential bias showed similar results. Lastly, because our study populations consist of mostly white health professionals who have adopted relatively healthy behaviors, the results may not be generalizable to other populations. Therefore, further studies are warranted to replicate our findings in other ethnic and racial groups and people with other professional backgrounds. However, the biologic effects of unhealthy behaviors are likely to apply to other populations, and the relative homogeneity of the study populations in educational attainment, health awareness, and socioeconomic status reduces residual confounding and enhances the internal validity.</p>\n",

      "        <p>We observed that a healthier lifestyle was associated with a lower risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes as well as mortality, with an increased total life expectancy and number of years lived free of these diseases. Our findings suggest that promotion of a healthy lifestyle would help to reduce the healthcare burdens through lowering the risk of developing multiple chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, and extending disease-free life expectancy. Public policies for improving food and the physical environment conducive to adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle, as well as relevant policies and regulations (for example, smoking ban in public places or trans-fat restrictions), are critical to improving life expectancy, especially life expectancy free of major chronic diseases.</p>\n",

      "      <p>The digitisation of society means we are amassing data at an unprecedented rate. Healthcare is no exception, with IBM estimating approximately one million gigabytes accruing over an average personâs lifetime and the overall volume of global healthcare data doubling every few years.<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref> To make sense of these big data, clinicians are increasingly collaborating with computer scientists and other allied disciplines to make use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that can help detect signal from noise.<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref> A recent forecast has placed the value of the healthcare AI market as growing from $2bn (Â£1.5bn; â¬1.8bn) in 2018 to $36bn by 2025, with a 50% compound annual growth rate.<xref rid=\"ref3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>\n",

      "      <p>Deep learning is a subset of AI which is formally defined as âcomputational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.â<xref rid=\"ref4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref> In practice, the main distinguishing feature between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in deep learning and traditional machine learning is that when CNNs are fed with raw data, they develop their own representations needed for pattern recognition; they do not require domain expertise to structure the data and design feature extractors.<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref> In plain language, the algorithm learns for itself the features of an image that are important for classification rather than being told by humans which features to use. A typical example would be feeding in raw chest radiographs tagged with a label such as either pneumothorax or no pneumothorax and the CNN learning which pixel patterns suggest pneumothorax. Fields such as medical imaging have seen a growing interest in deep learning research, with more and more studies being published.<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref> Some media headlines that claim superior performance to doctors have fuelled hype among the public and press for accelerated implementation. Examples include: âGoogle says its AI can spot lung cancer a year before doctorsâ and âAI is better at diagnosing skin cancer than your doctor, study finds.â<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>\n",

      "      <p>The methods and risk of bias of studies behind such headlines have not been examined in detail. The danger is that public and commercial appetite for healthcare AI outpaces the development of a rigorous evidence base to support this comparatively young field. Ideally, the path to implementation would involve two key steps. Firstly, well conducted and well reported development and validation studies that describe an algorithm and its properties in detail, including predictive accuracy in the target setting. Secondly, well conducted and transparently reported randomised clinical trials that evaluate usefulness in the real world. Both steps are important to ensure clinical practice is determined based on the best evidence standards.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>\n",

Appendix 1 presents the exact search strategy. Several electronic databases were searched from 2010 to June 2019: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP) search portal. Additional articles were retrieved by manually scrutinising the reference lists of relevant publications.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We selected publications for review if they satisfied several inclusion criteria: a peer reviewed scientific report of original research; English language; assessed a deep learning algorithm applied to a clinical problem in medical imaging; compared algorithm performance with a contemporary human group not involved in establishing the ground truth (the true target disease status verified by best clinical practice); and at least one human in the group was considered an expert. We included studies when the aim was to use medical imaging for predicting absolute risk of existing disease or classification into diagnostic groups (eg, disease or non-disease). Exclusion criteria included informal publication types (such as commentaries, letters to the editor, editorials, meeting abstracts). Deep learning for the purpose of medical imaging was defined as computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction (in practice through a CNN; see <xref ref-type=\"boxed-text\" rid=\"box1\">box 1</xref>).<xref rid=\"ref4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref> A clinical problem was defined as a situation in which a patient would usually see a medical professional to improve or manage their health (this did not include segmentation tasks, eg, delineating the borders of a tumour to calculate tumour volume). An expert was defined as an appropriately board certified specialist, attending physician, or equivalent. A real world clinical environment was defined as a situation in which the algorithm was embedded into an active clinical pathway. For example, instead of an algorithm being fed thousands of chest radiographs from a database, in a real world implementation it would exist within the reporting software used by radiologists and be acting or supporting the radiologists in real time.</p>\n",

CNNs are structurally inspired by the hierarchical arrangement of neurons within the brain. They can take many nuanced forms but the basic structure consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and a final output layer. Each hidden layer responds to a different aspect of the raw input. In the case of imaging, this could be an edge, colour, or specific pattern.</p>\n",

The algorithm did not typically receive information on characteristics such as patient age, sex, and medical history. Therefore, we used a modified list of 29 total points (see appendix 2).

These results were significantly lower than accuracy of diagnosis (99%, sensitivity 98%, specificity 99.6%) and treatment recommendation (97%, sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%) by senior consultants (P&lt;0.001 for both); and also lower than the results for the same AI when tested in a non-randomised clinical trial setting (98% and 93%, respectively). The mean time for receiving a diagnosis with the AI platform was faster than diagnosis by consultants (2.8 <italic>v</italic> 8.5 minutes, P&lt;0.001). The authors suggested that this might explain why patients were more satisfied with AI (mean satisfaction score 3.47 <italic>v</italic> 3.38, P=0.007).

Nine of 81 (11%) non-randomised studies were prospective, but only six of these nine were tested in a real world clinical environment. The US and Asia accounted for 82% of studies, with the top four countries as follows: US (24/81, 30%), China (14/81, 17%), South Korea (12/81, 15%), and Japan (9/81, 11%). The top five specialties were radiology (36/81, 44%), ophthalmology (17/81, 21%), dermatology (9/81, 11%), gastroenterology (5/81, 6%), and histopathology (5/81, 6%). Eighteen (22%) studies compared how long a task took in AI and human arms in addition to accuracy or performance metrics. Funding was predominantly academic (47/81, 58%) as opposed to commercial (9/81, 11%) or mixed (1/81, 1%). Twelve studies stated they had no funding and another 12 did not report on funding.

      "      <p>We have conducted an appraisal of the methods, adherence to reporting standards, risk of bias, and claims of deep learning studies that compare diagnostic AI performance with human clinicians. The rapidly advancing nature and commercial drive of this field has created pressure to introduce AI algorithms into clinical practice as quickly as possible. The potential consequences for patients of this implementation without a rigorous evidence base make our findings timely and should guide efforts to improve the design, reporting, transparency, and nuanced conclusions of deep learning studies.<xref rid=\"ref23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>\n",

      "        <title>Principal findings</title>\n",
      "        <p>Five key findings were established from our review. Firstly, we found few relevant randomised clinical trials (ongoing or completed) of deep learning in medical imaging. While time is required to move from development to validation to prospective feasibility testing before conducting a trial, this means that claims about performance against clinicians should be tempered accordingly. However, deep learning only became mainstream in 2014, giving a lead time of approximately five years for testing within clinical environments, and prospective studies could take a minimum of one to two years to conduct. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that many similar trials will be forthcoming over the next decade. We found only one randomised trial registered in the US despite at least 16 deep learning algorithms for medical imaging approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These algorithms cover a range of fields from radiology to ophthalmology and cardiology.<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>Secondly, of the non-randomised studies, only nine were prospective and just six were tested in a real world clinical environment. Comparisons of AI performance against human clinicians are therefore difficult to evaluate given the artificial in silico context in which clinicians are being evaluated. In much the same way that surrogate endpoints do not always reflect clinical benefit,<xref rid=\"ref26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref> a higher area under the curve might not lead to clinical benefit and could even have unintended adverse effects. Such effects could include an unacceptably high false positive rate, which is not apparent from an in silico evaluation. Yet it is typically retrospective studies that are usually cited in FDA approval notices for marketing of algorithms. Currently, the FDA do not mandate peer reviewed publication of these studies; instead internal review alone is performed.<xref rid=\"ref27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref> However, the FDA has recognised and acknowledged that their traditional paradigm of medical device regulation was not designed for adaptive AI and machine learning technologies. Non-inferior AI (rather than superior) performance that allows for a lower burden on clinician workflow (that is, being quicker with similar accuracy) might warrant further investigation. However, less than a quarter of studies reported time taken for task completion in both the AI and human groups. Ensuring fair comparison between AI and clinicians is arguably done best in a randomised clinical trial (or at the very least prospective) setting. However, it should be noted that prospective testing is not necessary to actually develop the model in the first place. Even in a randomised clinical trial setting, ensuring that functional robustness tests are present is crucial. For example, does the algorithm produce the correct decision for normal anatomical variants and is the decision independent of the camera or imaging software used?</p>\n",
      "        <p>Thirdly, limited availability of datasets and code makes it difficult to assess the reproducibility of deep learning research. Descriptions of the hardware used, when present, were also brief and this vagueness might affect external validity and implementation. Reproducible research has become a pressing issue across many scientific disciplines and efforts to encourage data and code sharing are crucial.<xref rid=\"ref29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref> Even when commercial concerns exist about intellectual property, strong arguments exist for ensuring that algorithms are non-proprietary and available for scrutiny.<xref rid=\"ref32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref> Commercial companies could collaborate with non-profit third parties for independent prospective validation.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Fourthly, the number of humans in the comparator group was typically small with a median of only four experts. There can be wide intra and inter case variation even between expert clinicians. Therefore, an appropriately large human sample for comparison is essential for ensuring reliability. Inclusion of non-experts can dilute the average human performance and potentially make the AI algorithm look better than it otherwise might. If the algorithm is designed specifically to aid performance of more junior clinicians or non-specialists rather than experts, then this should be made clear.</p>\n",
      "        <p>Fifthly, descriptive phrases that suggested at least comparable (or better) diagnostic performance of an algorithm to a clinician were found in most abstracts, despite studies having overt limitations in design, reporting, transparency, and risk of bias. Caveats about the need for further prospective testing were rarely mentioned in the abstract (and not at all in the 23 studies that claimed superior performance to a clinician). Accepting that abstracts are usually word limited, even in the discussion sections of the main text, nearly two thirds of studies failed to make an explicit recommendation for further prospective studies or trials. One retrospective study gave a website address in the abstract for patients to upload their eye scans and use the algorithm themselves.<xref rid=\"ref33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref> Overpromising language leaves studies vulnerable to being misinterpreted by the media and the public. Although it is clearly beyond the power of authors to control how the media and public interpret their findings, judicious and responsible use of language in studies and press releases that factor in the strength and quality of the evidence can help.<xref rid=\"ref34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref> This issue is especially concerning given the findings from new research that suggests patients are more likely to consider a treatment beneficial when news stories are reported with spin, and that false news spreads much faster online than true news.<xref rid=\"ref35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\n",

      "        <title>Study limitations</title>\n",
      "        <p>Our findings must be considered in light of several limitations. Firstly, although comprehensive, our search might have missed some studies that could have been included. Secondly, the guidelines that we used to assess non-randomised studies (TRIPOD and PROBAST) were designed for conventional prediction modelling studies, and so the adherence levels we found should be interpreted in this context. Thirdly, we focused specifically on deep learning for diagnostic medical imaging. Therefore, it might not be appropriate to generalise our findings to other types of AI, such as conventional machine learning (eg, an artificial neural network based mortality prediction model that uses electronic health record data). Similar issues could exist in many other types of AI paper, however we cannot definitively make this claim from our findings because we only assessed medical imaging studies. Moreover, nomenclature in the field is sometimes used in non-standardised ways, and thus some potentially eligible studies might have been presented with terminology that did not lead to them being captured with our search strategy. Fourthly, risk of bias entails some subjective judgment and people with different experiences of AI performance could have varying perceptions.</p>\n",

      "        <p>Deep learning AI is an innovative and fast moving field with the potential to improve clinical outcomes. Financial investment is pouring in, global media coverage is widespread, and in some cases algorithms are already at marketing and public adoption stage. However, at present, many arguably exaggerated claims exist about equivalence with or superiority over clinicians, which presents a risk for patient safety and population health at the societal level, with AI algorithms applied in some cases to millions of patients. Overpromising language could mean that some studies might inadvertently mislead the media and the public, and potentially lead to the provision of inappropriate care that does not align with patientsâ best interests. The development of a higher quality and more transparently reported evidence base moving forward will help to avoid hype, diminish research waste, and protect patients.</p>\n",

No high quality evidence was found for interventions to reduce the primary outcome (incidence of PPCs). Seven interventions had low or moderate quality evidence with confidence intervals indicating a probable reduction in PPCs: enhanced recovery pathways (risk ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.58), prophylactic mucolytics (0.40, 0.23 to 0.67), postoperative continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (0.49, 0.24 to 0.99), lung protective intraoperative ventilation (0.52, 0.30 to 0.88), prophylactic respiratory physiotherapy (0.55, 0.32 to 0.93), epidural analgesia (0.77, 0.65 to 0.92), and goal directed haemodynamic therapy (0.87, 0.77 to 0.98). Moderate quality evidence showed no benefit for incentive spirometry in preventing PPCs. Trial sequential analysis adjustment confidently supported a relative risk reduction of 25% in PPCs for prophylactic respiratory physiotherapy, epidural analgesia, enhanced recovery pathways, and goal directed haemodynamic therapies. Insufficient data were available to support or refute equivalent relative risk reductions for other interventions.</p>\n",

      "      <title>Introduction</title>\n",
      "      <p>Despite advances in perioperative care for patients undergoing major surgery, postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The term PPC encompasses a range of conditions affecting the respiratory system, typically within the first week after surgery. Examples range from atelectasis to respiratory failure.<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "      <p>PPCs are among the most common post-surgical complications,<xref rid=\"ref3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref> with a prevalence between 1% and 23%, varying considerably depending on patient related and surgical factors. For example, ankle surgery in a healthy, young person may have risk of PPCs of less than 1% and upper gastrointestinal surgery in a frail, older patient will have a much higher risk. Proximity of surgical incision to the thorax, where pain disrupts the performance of respiratory muscles after surgery, is a strong predictor of PPCs, as is age, with even healthy older patients being at higher risk of PPCs.<xref rid=\"ref8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref> PPCs are also predictors of short term and long term health outcomes after surgery and are associated with increased risk of admission to critical care and prolonged length of hospital stay.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref> Between 14% and 30% of patients developing a PPC will die within 30 days of major surgery, compared with 0.2-3% of those without a PPC.<xref rid=\"ref9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">9</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "      <p>The causes of PPCs are multifactorial and relate to both the patientâs chronic health and the acute adverse effects of surgery with accompanying anaesthesia.<xref rid=\"ref11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref> Surgery itself can depress lung function, particularly when surgical pain impairs breathing. Anaesthesia adversely affects lung function intraoperatively, and, to a lesser extent, these effects persist into the postoperative period. Well established chronic risk factors for PPC include poor cardiorespiratory health, increased age, lifestyle factors, and habitus.<xref rid=\"ref12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "      <p>Fortunately, multiple opportunities exist to intervene and therefore potentially prevent the development of PPCs. Interventions are diverse, covering pre-emptive strategies (before surgery) to optimise respiratory physiology and intraoperative and postoperative interventions to minimise the adverse effects of surgery and anaesthesia. <xref rid=\"tbl1\" ref-type=\"table\">Table 1</xref> shows examples of interventions used in clinical practice in resourced healthcare systems.</p>\n",

We aimed to compare quality, quantity, and risk of bias for evidence of treatment effects for PPC management. Inherent to this approach is a focus on whether benefits are associated with each treatment, rather than comparing their adverse effects. This is because although the benefits of treatments should be similar, the harms vary substantially because the interventions work in very different ways and they may not share common harms. The principal purpose of the review is to inform clinicians wishing to improve their evidence based perioperative care pathways and, by highlighting deficiencies in our evidence base, to facilitate researchers and funders in focusing on areas of greatest need.</p>\n",

The primary outcome measure of PPC was reported or derived for all studies. Reporting of secondary PPC subtypes varied (<xref rid=\"tbl4\" ref-type=\"table\">table 4</xref>). We identified 34 different strategies for reducing the risk of PPCs, which we grouped into 11 categories based on mode of intervention (<xref rid=\"tbl5\" ref-type=\"table\">table 5</xref>). Analysis of funnel plots showed no obvious evidence of publication bias or that results of smaller trials were systematically different from those of larger trials (appendix 2).

A further seven interventions did not meet statistical limits (all P&gt;0.05) for treatment benefit: restrictive versus liberal fluid administration strategies, postoperative bi-level non-invasive ventilation, postoperative high flow nasal cannula oxygenation, smoking cessation therapy, inhaled Î² agonists, incentive spirometry, and variation in intraoperative fractional inspiration oxygen concentration (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f3\">fig 3</xref>). Confidence intervals for risk ratios derived from conventional meta-analysis indicate wide imprecision for most estimates of the treatment effects of interventions.

A further five interventions had low quality evidence of treatment benefit: enhanced recovery pathways, prophylactic mucolytics, postoperative continuous positive airway pressure ventilation, prophylactic respiratory physiotherapy, and epidural analgesia.

Trials of goal directed haemodynamic therapy have shown a reduction in several postoperative complications, and our meta-analysis confirms this specifically for pulmonary complications. In this study, a subgroup meta-analysis of trials that relied solely on the administration of fluids (goal directed fluid therapy) for haemodynamic optimisation without the use of vasoactive drugs shows a reduction in the risk of PPCs (risk ratio 0.47, 0.32 to 0.71; P=0.001).

      "        <title>Role for care bundles?</title>\n",
      "        <p>Substantial changes in the perioperative care of patients have occurred in the past decade. An increasingly popular and evidence based approach to minimise the risk of complications in surgical and medical patients is the adoption of care bundles. Care bundles are collections of evidence based practices (ideally no more than five interventions in one bundle), which when performed together result in better outcomes than when applied individually. Recent research from our group has clarified important principles for care bundles<xref rid=\"ref140\" ref-type=\"bibr\">140</xref>: interventions within a care bundle should reflect best practice, bundles with a small number of simple elements have better compliance rates, bundles should also be used to guide teamwork in achieving care delivery, and measurement of success is binaryâall of the individual interventions need to be implemented together in a single patient for delivery of the bundle to be considered compliant. Such bundles have already been shown to reduce some postoperative complications,<xref rid=\"ref141\" ref-type=\"bibr\">141</xref> particularly surgical site infection.<xref rid=\"ref142\" ref-type=\"bibr\">142</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref143\" ref-type=\"bibr\">143</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>Despite care bundles being strongly endorsed for prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia in intensive care,<xref rid=\"ref144\" ref-type=\"bibr\">144</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref145\" ref-type=\"bibr\">145</xref> evidence for equivalent non-ventilator bundles in perioperative patient care to prevent PPCs is still uncertain.<xref rid=\"ref146\" ref-type=\"bibr\">146</xref> An international Delphi consensus process considered which interventions might best be combined to reduce PPCs,<xref rid=\"ref147\" ref-type=\"bibr\">147</xref> and a UK based, patient centred quality improvement project (ERAS+) used a PPC reduction care bundle with notable success.<xref rid=\"ref148\" ref-type=\"bibr\">148</xref> To date, these care bundles have predominantly included relatively simple and inexpensive interventions, often with imperfect evidence of efficacy. Ideally, the interventions within a care bundle would have robust supportive evidence and interact with each other synergistically. We propose that the evidence from this review be used to guide development of care bundles for prevention of PPCs, although we acknowledge that further research is needed to determine the ideal components of PPC bundles and establish evidence of effectiveness.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Implications for research</title>\n",
      "        <p>The most common reason for RCTs to be excluded from the analysis phase of this review was a lack of reported clinical PPC outcomes, with many trials using more easily measured surrogate recordings such as lung spirometry tests instead. We suggest that clinically detectable pathology, such as PPCs, is more meaningful to patients and should be used to design relevant future research. Trials should use standardised definitions for PPCs, such as the EPCO criteria or the recently published standardised endpoints in perioperative medicine (StEP) initiative PPC definitions.<xref rid=\"ref1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "        <p>Likewise, although this review evaluates the best available RCT evidence for PPCs, other forms of evidence are available. For example, the adverse influence of neuromuscular blocking drugs is now well established,<xref rid=\"ref149\" ref-type=\"bibr\">149</xref>\n",
      "<xref rid=\"ref150\" ref-type=\"bibr\">150</xref>\n",

      "<xref rid=\"ref153\" ref-type=\"bibr\">153</xref> especially when they are associated with inadequate reversal (a train of four ratio of &lt;0.9). Furthermore, active intraoperative warming, airway suctioning, and choice of airway device are all relevant interventions with an effect on PPCs. However, most of the above interventions have been predominantly studied in observational, rather than randomised, trial designs or with evidence translated from critical care, rather than surgical, patient cohorts. Hence, the pool of randomised studies of adult surgical patients with clinical outcomes for several of the interventions was surprisingly small. The results from this review therefore need to be interpreted in the context of other forms of relevant evidence and clearly indicate a role for large, well designed propensity score studies in best understanding the role of intraoperative interventions that are challenging to study in RCTs.</p>\n",

      "        <title>Strengths and limitations of review</title>\n",
      "        <p>Using robust and standardised methods including GRADE methods and pre-specified analyses, we comprehensive reviewed a vast literature spanning anaesthesia, surgery, and respiratory and intensive care medicine. This included meta-analysis of treatment effects and trial sequential analysis. We used trial sequential analysis to explore the risk of random error as a result of sparse data and repetitive testing in order to increase the robustness of the meta-analyses and distinguish the current information size from the required information size.</p>\n",
      "        <p>However, in our study, and in general, the literature evaluating interventions to reduce PPCs is limited by several factors. The quality of trials was mixed, with only a minority being large, multicentre studies with a low risk of bias. Heterogeneity of trial design and outcome measures used, and variation in surveillance fidelity and diagnostic classifications for PPC outcomes, pose a problem for evidence synthesis. We anticipated heterogeneity and used random effect model analysis and trial sequential analysis to provide conservative estimates of treatment effects and reduce false positives.</p>\n",
      "        <p>As a composite measure, PPCs do not convey the precise nature of complications that are experienced by patients. One intervention may have a relatively larger effect on atelectasis than on respiratory infection, for example. For this reason, we specifically evaluated the individual outcomes of respiratory infection, atelectasis, mortality, and length of hospital stay in our meta-analyses.</p>\n",
      "        <p>The quality of the literature we evaluated was also limited by imprecise and varying descriptions of the interventions. We identified significant heterogeneity in several aspects of the included trials, such as precise terms, timings and limits of tested interventions, characteristics of participants in trials, surgery type, outcome measurement timings and definitions, and other factors that might influence PPCs such as fluid therapy, analgesia types, and smoking status. This information was also not universally available for the patients included in the trials we analysed.</p>\n",
      "        <p>We have focused on the evidence of efficacy in reducing PPCs and not taken into consideration other factors that would be necessary to evaluate effectiveness or whether these interventions would be suitable to introduce, either in isolation or within a âcare bundle.â The breadth of this review, in terms of number of trials and range of interventions studied, necessarily meant that we were unable to compare individual adverse effects. Adverse effects were often intervention specific and lacked a common outcome framework between trials. We have also not considered the costs of the interventions, nor their tolerance, concordance, or acceptability for patients.</p>\n",
